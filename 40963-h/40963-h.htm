<h2>THE MYSTERY AT NUMBER SEVEN</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;MONTPELLIER-BY-SEA</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go and give her a turn,&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p>Tod laughed. &ldquo;What, all of us?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure. All of us. Why not? We&rsquo;ll start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Todhetley, dismay in her
mild tones. &ldquo;Children and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children and all; and take Hannah to see to them,&rdquo;
said the Squire. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t count, Joe: you will be off
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could never be ready,&rdquo; said the Mater, looking the
image of perplexity. &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Friday. Besides, there
would be no time to write to Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Write to her!</em>&rdquo; cried the Squire, turning sharply on
his heel as he paced the room in his nankeen morning-coat.
&ldquo;And who do you suppose is going to write to her?
Why, it would cause her to make all sorts of preparation,
put her to no end of trouble. A pretty conjurer you&rsquo;d make!
We will take her by surprise: that&rsquo;s what we will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if, when we got there, we should find her rooms are
let, sir?&rdquo; said I, the possibility striking me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go into others, Johnny. A spell at the seaside
will be a change for us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>This conversation, and the Squire&rsquo;s planning-out, arose
through a letter we had just received from Mary Blair&mdash;poor
Blair&rsquo;s widow, if you have not forgotten him, who went to
his end through that Gazette of Jerry&rsquo;s. After a few ups and
downs, trying at this thing for a living, trying at that, Mrs.
Blair had now settled in a house at the seaside, and opened
a day-school. She hoped to get on in it in time, she wrote,
especially if she could be so fortunate as to let her drawing-room
to visitors. The Squire, always impulsive and good-hearted,
at once cried out that <em>we</em> would go and take it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be doing her a good turn, you see,&rdquo; he ran on;
&ldquo;and when we leave I dare say she&rsquo;ll find other people ready
to go in. Let&rsquo;s see&rdquo;&mdash;picking up the letter to refer to the
address&mdash;&ldquo;No.&nbsp;6, Seaboard Terrace, Montpellier-by-Sea.
Whereabouts is Montpellier-by-Sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard of it in my life,&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
believe there is such a place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Joe. I fancy it lies somewhere towards
Saltwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod flung back his head. &ldquo;Saltwater! A nice common
place that is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir. Johnny, fetch me the railway
guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon looking at the guide, it was found there; &ldquo;Montpellier-by-Sea;&rdquo;
the last station before getting to Saltwater.
As to Saltwater, it might be common, as Tod said; for it was
crowded with all sorts of people, but it was lively and healthy.</p>

<p>Not on the next day, Friday, for it was impossible to get
ready in such a heap of a hurry, but on the following
Tuesday we started. Tod had left on the Saturday for
Gloucestershire. His own mother&rsquo;s relatives lived there,
and they were always inviting him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Montpellier-by-Sea?&rdquo; cried the railway clerk in a doubting
tone as we were getting the tickets. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see? Where
is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course that set the Squire exploding. What right had
clerks to pretend to issue tickets unless they knew their
business? The clerk in question coolly ran his finger down
the railway list he had turned to, and then gave us the
tickets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a station not much frequented, you see,&rdquo; he civilly
observed. &ldquo;Travellers mostly go on to Saltwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But for the train being due, and our having to make a
rush for the platform, the Squire would have waited to give
the young man a piece of his mind. &ldquo;Saltwater, indeed!&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I wonder the fellow does not issue his edict as
to where people shall go and where they shan&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We arrived in due time at our destination. It was written
up as large as life on a white board, &ldquo;Montpellier-by-Sea.&rdquo;
A small roadside station, open to the country around; no
signs of sea or of houses to be seen; a broad rural district,
apparently given over entirely to agriculture. On went the
whistling train, leaving the group of us standing by our
luggage on the platform. The Squire was staring about him
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where Seaboard Terrace is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seaboard Terrace?&rdquo; repeated the station-master. &ldquo;No,
sir, I don&rsquo;t know it. There&rsquo;s no terrace of that name hereabouts.
For that matter there are no terraces at all&mdash;no
houses in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire&rsquo;s face was a picture. He saw that (save a
solitary farm homestead or two) the country was bare of
dwelling-places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Montpellier-by-Sea?&rdquo; he questioned at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough it is, sir. Munpler, it&rsquo;s called down here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Seaboard Terrace must be <em>somewhere</em> in it&mdash;somewhere
about. What a strange thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the gentlefolks want to go to Saltwater?&rdquo; spoke
up one of the two porters employed at the little station.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of terraces there. Here, Jim!&rdquo;&mdash;calling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his fellow&mdash;&ldquo;come here a minute. He&rsquo;ll know, sir; he
comes from Saltwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim approached, and settled the doubt at once. He
knew Seaboard Terrace very well indeed; it was at Saltwater;
just out at the eastern end of it.</p>

<p>Yes, it was at Saltwater. And there were we, more than
two miles off it, on a broiling hot day, when walking was
impracticable, with all our trunks about us, and no fly to
be had, or other means of getting on. The Squire went
into one of his passions, and demanded why people living at
Saltwater should give their address as Montpellier-by-Sea.</p>

<p>He had hardly patience to listen to the station-master&rsquo;s
explanation&mdash;who acknowledged that we were not the first
travelling party that had been deluded in like manner.
Munpler (as he and the rest of the natives persisted in calling
it) was an extensive, straggling rural parish, filled with
farm lands; an arm of it extended as far as Saltwater, and
the new buildings at that end of Saltwater had rechristened
themselves Montpellier-by-Sea, deeming it more aristocratic
than the common old name. Had the Squire been able to
transport the new buildings, builders and all, he had surely
done it on the spot.</p>

<p>Well, we got on to Saltwater in the evening by another
train, and to No.&nbsp;6, Seaboard Terrace. Mary Blair was
just delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had but known you were coming, if you had only
written to me, I would have explained that it was Saltwater
Station you must get out at, not Montpellier,&rdquo; she cried in
deprecation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, why on earth do you give in to a deception?&rdquo;
stormed the Squire. &ldquo;Why call your place Montpellier
when it&rsquo;s Saltwater?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do what other people do,&rdquo; she sighed; &ldquo;I was told
it was Montpellier when I came here. Generally speaking,
I have explained, when writing to friends, that it is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Saltwater, in spite of its fine name. I suppose I forgot it
when writing to you&mdash;I had so much to say. The people
really to blame are those who named it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true, and they ought to be shown up,&rdquo; said
the Squire.</p>

<p>Seaboard Terrace consisted of seven houses, built in front
of the sea a little beyond the town. The parlours had bay
windows; the drawing-rooms had balconies and verandahs.
The two end houses, Nos. 1 and 7, were double houses,
large and handsome, each of them being inhabited by a
private family; the middle houses were smaller, most of
them being let out in lodgings in the season. Mary Blair
began talking that first evening as we sat together about the
family who lived in the house next door to her, No.&nbsp;7. Their
name was Peahern, she said, and they had been so very,
very kind to her since she took her house in March. Mr.
Peahern had interested himself for her and got her several
pupils; he was much respected at Saltwater. &ldquo;Ah, he is
a good man,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call and thank him,&rdquo; interrupted the Squire. &ldquo;I am
proud to shake hands with such a man as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he and his wife have gone
abroad. A great misfortune has lately befallen them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great misfortune! What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I noticed a sort of cloud pass over Mary Blair&rsquo;s face,
a hesitation in her manner before she replied. Mrs.
Todhetley was sitting by her on the sofa; the Squire was
in the armchair opposite them, and I at the table, as I had
sat at our tea-dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Peahern was in business once&mdash;a wholesale druggist,
I believe; but he made a fortune, and retired some years
ago,&rdquo; began Mary. &ldquo;Mrs. Peahern has bad health and is
a little lame. She was very kind to me also&mdash;very good
and kind indeed. They had one son&mdash;no other children;
I think he was studying for the Bar; I am not sure; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
lived in London, and came down here occasionally. My
young maid-servant, Susan, got acquainted with their
servants, and she gathered from their gossip that he, Edmund
Peahern, a very handsome young man, was in some way a
trouble to his parents. He was down at Easter, and stayed
three weeks; and in May he came down again. What
happened I don&rsquo;t know; I believe there was some scene
with his father the day he arrived; anyway, Mr. Peahern
was heard talking angrily to him; and that night he&mdash;he
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had dropped her voice to a whisper. The Squire
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Died! Was it a natural death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. A jury decided that he was insane; and he was
buried here in the churchyard. Such a heap of claims and
debts came to light, it was said. Mr. Peahern left his
lawyer to pay them all, and went abroad with his poor wife
for change of scene. It has been a great grief to me. I
feel so sorry for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, is the house shut up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Two servants are left in it&mdash;the two housemaids.
The cook, who had lived with them five and twenty years
and was dreadfully affected at the calamity, went with her
mistress. Nice, good-natured young women are these two
that are left, running in most days to ask if they can do
anything for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good to have such neighbours,&rdquo; said the Squire.
&ldquo;And I hope you&rsquo;ll get on, my dear. How came you to be
at this place at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was through Mr. Lockett,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;the clergyman
who had been so much with her husband before he died,
and who had kept up a correspondence with her. Mr.
Lockett&rsquo;s brother was in practice as a doctor at Saltwater,
and they thought she might perhaps do well if she came to
it. So Mary&rsquo;s friends had screwed a point or two to put her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
into the house, and gave her besides a ten-pound note to
start with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, young Joe: if you run and reve
yourself into that scarlet heat, you shan&rsquo;t come here with me
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I like to race with the donkeys,&rdquo; replied young Joe.
&ldquo;I can run almost as fast as they, Johnny. I like to see
the donkeys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to ride a donkey, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I have never had a ride but once,&rdquo;
he answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no sixpences for it. That once Matilda
treated me. She brings me on the sands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Matilda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda at No.&nbsp;7&mdash;Mr. Peahern&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you are a good boy, young Joe, and stay by me,
you shall have a ride as soon as the donkeys come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were fine sands. I sat down on a bench with a
book; little Joe strained his eyes to look after the donkeys
in the distance, cantering off with some young shavers like
himself on their backs, their nursemaids walking quickly
after them. Poor little Joe!&mdash;he had the gentlest, meekest
face in the world, with his thoughtful look and nice eyes&mdash;waited
and watched in quiet patience. The sands were
crowded with people this afternoon; organs were playing,
dancing dolls exhibiting; and vessels with their white sails
spread glided smoothly up and down on the sparkling sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you really pay the sixpence?&rdquo; asked the little
fellow presently. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let me get on for less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really and truly, Joe. I&rsquo;ll take you for a row in a boat
some calm day, if mamma will allow you to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe looked grave. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>much</em> like the water, please,&rdquo;
said he, timidly. &ldquo;Alfred Dale went on it in a boat and
fell in, and was nearly drowned. He comes to mamma&rsquo;s
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll let the boats alone, Joe. There&rsquo;s Punch!
He is going to set himself up yonder: wouldn&rsquo;t you like to
run and see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I might miss the donkeys,&rdquo; answered Joe.</p>

<p>He stood by me quietly, gazing in the direction taken by
the donkeys; evidently they were his primary attraction.
The other child, Mary, who was a baby when her father
died (poor Baked Pie, as we boys used to call him at
Frost&rsquo;s), was in Wales with Mrs. Blair&rsquo;s people. They had
taken the child for a few months, until she saw whether she
should get along at Saltwater.</p>

<p>But we thought she would get along. Her school was a
morning school for little boys of good parentage, all of
whom paid liberal terms; and she would be able to let her
best rooms for at least six months in the year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Matilda! Oh, there&rsquo;s Matilda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite a loud shout for little Joe. Looking up, I
saw him rush to a rather good-looking young woman, neatly
dressed in a black-and-white print gown and small shawl of
the same, with black ribbons crossed on her straw bonnet.
Servants did not dress fine enough to set the Thames on
fire in those days. Joe dragged her triumphantly up to me.
She was one of the housemaids at No.&nbsp;7.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Matilda,&rdquo; he said; and the young woman curtsied.
&ldquo;And I am going to have a donkey-ride, Matilda; Mr.
Johnny Ludlow&rsquo;s going to give the sixpence for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you by sight, sir,&rdquo; observed Matilda to me. &ldquo;I
have seen you go in and out of No.&nbsp;6.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had a pale olive complexion, with magnificent,
melancholy dark eyes. Many persons would have called her
handsome. I took a sort of liking for the girl&mdash;if only for
her kindness to poor little fatherless Joe. In manner she
was particularly quiet, subdued, and patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had a sad misfortune at your house not long ago,&rdquo;
I observed to her, at a loss for something to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, don&rsquo;t talk of it, please!&rdquo; she answered, catching
her breath. &ldquo;I seem to have had the shivers at times ever
since. It was me that found him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up cantered the donkeys; and presently away went Joe
on the back of one, Matilda attending him. The ride was
just over, and Joe beginning to enlarge on its delights to
me, when another young woman, dressed precisely similar to
Matilda, even to the zigzag white running pattern on the
prim gown, and the black cotton gloves, was seen making
her way towards us. She was nice-looking also, in a different
way&mdash;fair, with blue eyes, and a laughing, arch face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Jane Cross!&rdquo; exclaimed Matilda. &ldquo;What
in the world have you come out for, Jane? Have you left
the house safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I should leave it unsafe!&rdquo; lightly retorted the one
they had called Jane Cross. &ldquo;The back door&rsquo;s locked, and
here&rsquo;s the key of the front&rdquo;&mdash;showing a huge key. &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I go out if you do, Matilda? The house is none
so lively a one now, to stop in all alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; was Matilda&rsquo;s quiet answer.
&ldquo;Little master Joe&rsquo;s here; he has been having a donkey-ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two servants, fellow-housemaids, strolled off towards
the sea, taking Joe with them. At the edge of the beach
they encountered Hannah, who had just come on with our
two children, Hugh and Lena. The maids sat down for a
gossip, while the children took off their shoes and stockings
to dabble in the gently rising tide.</p>

<p>And that was my introductory acquaintanceship with the
servant-maids at No.&nbsp;7. Unfortunately it did not end there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twilight was coming on. We had been out and about
all day, had dined as usual at one o&rsquo;clock (not to give
unnecessary trouble), and had just finished tea in Mrs.
Blair&rsquo;s parlour. It was where we generally took tea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
supper also. The Squire liked to sit in the open bay
window and watch the passers-by as long as ever a glimmer
of daylight lasted; and he could not see them so well in the
drawing-room above. I was at the other corner of the bay
window. The Mater and Mary Blair were on their favourite
seat, the sofa, at the end of the room, both knitting. In the
room at the back, Mary held her morning school.</p>

<p>I sat facing towards the end house, No.&nbsp;7. And I must
here say that during the last two or three weeks I had met
the housemaids several times on the sands, and so had
become quite at home with each of them. Both appeared
to be thoroughly well-conducted, estimable young women;
but, of the two, I liked Jane Cross best; she was always so
lively and pleasant-mannered. One day she told me why
No.&nbsp;7 generally called her by her two names&mdash;which I had
thought rather odd. It appeared that when she entered her
place two years before, the other housemaid was named
Jane, so they took to call her by her full name, Jane Cross.
That housemaid had left in about a twelvemonth, and
Matilda had entered in her place. The servants were
regarded as equals in the house, not one above the other, as
is the case in many places. These details will probably
be thought unnecessary and uncalled for, but you will soon
see why I mention them. This was Monday. On the
morrow we should have been three weeks at Saltwater,
and the Squire did not yet talk of leaving. He was
enjoying the free-and-easy life, and was as fond as a child
of picking up shells on the sands and looking at Punch
and the dancing dolls.</p>

<p>Well, we sat this evening in the bay window as usual, I
facing No.&nbsp;7. Thus sitting, I saw Matilda cross the strip of
garden with a jug in her hand, and come out at the gate to
fetch the beer for supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes Jane Cross,&rdquo; cried the Squire, as she passed
the window. &ldquo;Is it not, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it&rsquo;s Matilda.&rdquo; But the mistake was a very
natural one, for the girls were about the same height and
size, and were usually dressed alike, the same mourning
having been supplied to both of them.</p>

<p>Ten minutes or so had elapsed when Matilda came
back: she liked a gossip with the landlady of the Swan.
Her pint jug was brimful of beer, and she shut the iron gate
of No.&nbsp;7 after her. Putting my head as far out at the
window as it would go, to watch her indoors, for no earthly
reason but that I had nothing else to do, I saw her try the
front door, and then knock at it. This knock she repeated
three times over at intervals, each knock being louder than
the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you shut out, Matilda?&rdquo; I called out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it seems like it,&rdquo; she called back again, without
turning her head. &ldquo;Jane Cross must have gone to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had she been a footman with a carriage full of ladies in
court trains behind him, she could not have given a louder
or longer knock than she gave now. There was no bell
to the front door at No.&nbsp;7. But the knock remained
unanswered and the door unopened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda at No.&nbsp;7 is locked out,&rdquo; I said, laughing,
bringing in my head and speaking to the parlour generally.
&ldquo;She has been to fetch the beer for supper, and can&rsquo;t get in
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beer for supper?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;They
generally go out at the back gate to fetch that, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, she took the front way to-night. I saw her
come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another tremendous knock. The Squire put his good
old nose round the window-post; two boys and a lady,
passing by, halted a minute to look on. It was getting
exciting, and I ran out. She was still at the door, which
stood in the middle of the house, between the sitting-rooms
on each side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have got the key of the street, Matilda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what Jane Cross can be
about, or why the door should be closed at all. I left it on
the latch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody has slipped in to make love to her. Your
friend, the milkman, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently Matilda did not like the allusion to the milkman.
Catching a glimpse of her face by the street lamp, I
saw it had turned white. The milkman was supposed to be
paying court at No.&nbsp;7, but to which of the two maids gossip
did not decide. Mrs. Blair&rsquo;s Susan, who knew them well,
said it was Matilda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try the back way?&rdquo; I asked, after more
waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I know the outer door is locked, sir. Jane
Cross locked it just now, and that&rsquo;s why I came out this
front way. I can try it, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went round to the road that ran by the side of the
house, and tried the door in the garden wall. It was
fastened, as she had said. Seizing the bell-handle, she gave
a loud peal&mdash;another, and another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, it seems odd, though,&rdquo; I cried, beginning to find
it so. &ldquo;Do you think she can have gone out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, sir. But&mdash;no; it&rsquo;s not likely,
Master Johnny. I left her laying the cloth for our supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she in the house alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are always alone, sir; we don&rsquo;t have visitors. Anyway,
none have been with us this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at the upper windows of the house. No light
was to be seen in any of them, no sign of Jane Cross. The
lower windows were hidden from view by the wall, which
was high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she must have dropped asleep, Matilda, as you
say. Suppose you come in through Mrs. Blair&rsquo;s and get
over the wall?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>I ran round to tell the news to our people. Matilda
followed me slowly; I thought, reluctantly. Even in the
dim twilight, as she stood at our gate in hesitation, I could
see how white her face was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo; I asked her, going out again
to where she stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know, Master Johnny. Jane Cross used to
have fits. Perhaps she has been frightened into one now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should frighten her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked round in a scared manner before replying.
Just then I found my jacket-sleeve wet. Her trembling
hands had shaken a little of the ale upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she&mdash;should have seen Mr. Edmund?&rdquo; the girl
brought out in a horrified whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen Mr. Edmund! Mr. Edmund who?&mdash;Mr. Edmund
Peahern? Why, you don&rsquo;t surely mean his ghost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face was growing whiter. I stared at her in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have always been afraid of seeing something, she
and me, since last May; we haven&rsquo;t liked the house at
night-time. It has often been quite a scuffle which of us
should fetch the beer, so as not to be the one left alone.
Many a time I have stood right out at the back door while
Jane Cross has gone for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to think her an idiot. If Jane Cross was another,
why, perhaps she had frightened herself into a fit. All the
more reason that somebody should see after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, Matilda; don&rsquo;t be foolish; we&rsquo;ll both get
over the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a calm, still summer evening, almost dark now.
All the lot of us went out to the back garden, I whispering
to them what the girl had said to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley, who had a sort of
fellow-feeling for ghosts. &ldquo;It has been very lonely for the
young women; and if Jane Cross is subject to fits, she may
be lying in one at this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The wall between the gardens was nothing like as high
as the outer one. Susan brought out a chair, and Matilda
could have got over easily. But when she reached the
top, she stuck there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on by myself; I dare not,&rdquo; she said, turning
her frightened face towards us. &ldquo;If Mr. Edmund is
there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose, girl!&rdquo; interrupted the Squire, in doubt
whether to laugh or scold. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll go with you. Get
on down. Hold the chair tight for me, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We hoisted him over without damage. I leaped after
him, and Susan, grinning with delight, came after me. She
supposed that Jane Cross had slipped out somewhere during
Matilda&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<p>The door faced the garden, and the Squire and Susan
were the first to enter. There seemed to be no light anywhere,
and the Squire went gingerly picking his way. I
turned round to look for Matilda, who had hung back, and
found her with her hand on the trellis-work of the porch,
and the beer splashing over in her fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, look here, Matilda; you must be a regular
goose, as the Squire says, to put yourself into this fright
before you know whether there&rsquo;s any cause for it. Susan
says she has only stepped out somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put up her hand and touched my arm, her lips the
colour of chalk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only last night that ever was, Mr. Johnny, as we were
going up the staircase to bed, we heard a sound in the
room as we passed it. It was just like a groan. Ask Jane
Cross, else, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Edmund&rsquo;s; where he did it. She has heard him
to-night, or seen him, or something, and has fallen into
a fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kitchen was on the right of the passage. Susan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
knowing the ways of the house, soon lighted a candle. On
a small round table was spread a white cloth, some bread
and cheese, and two tumblers. A knife or two had
seemingly been flung on it at random.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane Cross! Jane Cross!&rdquo; shouted the Squire, going
forward towards the front hall, Susan following with the
candle. It was a good-sized hall; I could see that, with a
handsome well-staircase at this end of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa! What&rsquo;s this? Johnny! Susan!&mdash;all of you
come here! Here&rsquo;s somebody lying here. It must be the
poor girl. Goodness bless my heart! Johnny, help me to
raise her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still and white she was lying, underneath the opening of
the staircase. Upon lifting her head, it fell back in a
curious manner. We both backed a little. Susan held the
candle nearer. As its light fell on the upturned face, the
girl shrieked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in a fit,&rdquo; cried Matilda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help her!&rdquo; whispered the Squire. &ldquo;I fear this is
something worse than a fit. We must have a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan thrust the candlestick into my hand, and ran out at
the back door, saying she&rsquo;d fetch Mr. Lockett. Back she
came in a moment: the garden gate was locked, and the
key not in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the front door, girl,&rdquo; stuttered the Squire, angry
with her for returning, though it was no fault of hers. He
was like one off his head, and his nose and cheeks had
turned blue.</p>

<p>But there could be no more exit by the front door than
by the back. It was locked, and the key gone. Who had
done these things? what strange mystery was here? Locking
the poor girl in the house to kill her!</p>

<p>Matilda, who had lighted another candle, found the key
of the back gate lying on the kitchen dresser. Susan caught
it up, and flew away. It was a most uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
moment. There lay Jane Cross, pale and motionless, and it
seemed that we were helpless to aid her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask that stupid thing to bring a pillow or a cushion,
Johnny! Ghosts, indeed! The idiots that women are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else has done it? what else was there to hurt
her?&rdquo; remonstrated Matilda, bringing up the second candle.
&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t fall into a fit for nothing, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now that more light was present, we began to see
other features of the scene. Nearly close to Jane Cross lay
a work-basket, overturned, a flat, open basket, a foot and a
half square. Reels of cotton, scissors, tapes, small bundles
of work tied up, and such-like things lay scattered around.</p>

<p>The Squire looked at these, and then at the opening
above. &ldquo;Can she have fallen down the well?&rdquo; he asked, in
a low tone. And Matilda, catching the words, gave a cry
of dismay, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pillow, girl! A pillow, or a cushion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into one of the sitting-rooms and brought out a
sofa-cushion. The Squire, going down on his knees, for he
was not good at stooping, told me to slip it under while he
raised the head.</p>

<p>A sound of feet, a sudden flash of light from a bull&rsquo;s-eye,
and a policeman came upon the scene. The man was
quietly passing on his beat when met by Susan. In her
excitement she told him what had happened, and sent him
in. We knew the man, whose beat lay at this end of Saltwater;
a civil man, named Knapp. He knelt down where
the Squire had just been kneeling, touching Jane Cross here
and there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There can be no mistake
about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have fallen down the well of the staircase, I
fear,&rdquo; observed the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes; perhaps so,&rdquo; assented the man in a doubtful
tone. &ldquo;But what of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>He flung the great light in front of poor Jane Cross&rsquo;s
dress. A small portion of the body, where the gown
fastened in front, had been torn away, as well as one of the
wristbands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fall,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s foul play&mdash;as I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness bless me!&rdquo; gasped the Squire. &ldquo;Some
villains must have got in. This comes of that other one&rsquo;s
having left the front door on the latch.&rdquo; But I am not sure
that any of us, including himself, believed she could be
really dead.</p>

<p>Susan returned with speed, and was followed by Mr.
Lockett. He was a young man, thirty perhaps, pale and
quiet, and much like what I remembered of his brother.
Poor Jane Cross was certainly dead, he said&mdash;had been
dead, he thought, an hour.</p>

<p>But this could scarcely have been, as we knew. It was
not, at the very utmost, above twenty-five minutes since
Matilda went out to fetch the beer, leaving her alive and
well. Mr. Lockett looked again, but thought he was not
mistaken. When a young doctor takes up a crotchet, he
likes to hold to it.</p>

<p>A nameless sensation of awe fell upon us all. Dead!
In that sudden manner! The Squire rubbed up his head
like a helpless lunatic; Susan&rsquo;s eyes were round with
horror; Matilda had thrown her apron over her face to hide
its grief and tears.</p>

<p>Leaving her for the present where she was, we turned to
go upstairs. I stooped to pick up the overturned basket,
but the policeman sharply told me to let all things remain
as they were until he had time to look into them.</p>

<p>The first thing the man did, on reaching the landing
above, was to open the room doors one by one, and throw
his bull&rsquo;s-eye light into them. They were all right, unoccupied,
straight and tidy. On the landing of the upper
floor lay one or two articles, which seemed to indicate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
some kind of struggle had taken place there. A thimble
here, a bodkin there, also the bit that had been torn out of
the girl&rsquo;s gown in front, and the wristband from the sleeve.
The balustrades were very handsome, but very low; on
this upper landing, dangerously low. These bedrooms were
all in order; the one in which the two servants slept, alone
showing signs of occupation.</p>

<p>Downstairs went Knapp again, carrying with him the torn-out
pieces, to compare them with the gown. It was the
print gown I had often seen Jane Cross wear, a black
gown with white zigzag lines running down it. Matilda
was wearing the fellow to it now. The pieces fitted in
exactly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The struggle must have taken place upstairs: not here,&rdquo;
observed the doctor.</p>

<p>Matilda, questioned and cross-questioned by the policeman,
gave as succinct an account of the evening as her
distressed state allowed. We stood round the kitchen while
she told it.</p>

<p>Neither she nor Jane Cross had gone out at all that day.
Monday was rather a busy day with them, for they generally
did a bit of washing. After tea, which they took between
four and five o&rsquo;clock, they went up to their bedroom, it being
livelier there than in the kitchen, the window looking down
the side road. Matilda sat down to write a letter to her
brother, who lived at a distance; Jane Cross sat at the
window doing a job of sewing. They sat there all the
evening, writing, working, and sometimes talking. At dusk,
Jane remarked that it was getting blind man&rsquo;s holiday, and
that she should go on downstairs and lay the supper. Upon
that, Matilda finished her letter quickly, folded and directed
it, and followed her down. Jane had not yet laid the cloth,
but was then taking it out of the drawer. &ldquo;You go and
fetch the beer, Matilda,&rdquo; she said: and Matilda was glad to
do so. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go that way: I have locked the gate,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Jane called out, seeing Matilda turning towards the back;
accordingly she went out at the front door, leaving it on the
latch. Such was her account; and I have given it almost
verbatim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the latch,&rdquo; repeated the policeman, taking up the
words. &ldquo;Does that mean that you left it open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drew it quite to, so that it looked as if it were shut; it
was a heavy door, and would keep so,&rdquo; was Matilda&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;I did it, not to give Jane the trouble to open it to me.
When I got back I found it shut and could not get in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The policeman mused. &ldquo;You say it was Jane Cross who
locked the back door in the wall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Matilda. &ldquo;She had locked it before I got
downstairs. We liked to lock that door early, because it
could be opened from the outside&mdash;while the front door could
not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she had not put these things on the table when you
went out for the beer?&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the dishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No: she was only then putting the cloth. As I turned
round from taking the beer-jug from its hook, the fling she
gave the cloth caused the air to whiffle in my face like a wind.
She had not begun to reach out the dishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long were you away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly,&rdquo; she answered, with a moan.
&ldquo;Rather longer than usual, because I took my letter to the
post before going to the Swan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was about ten minutes,&rdquo; I interposed. &ldquo;I was at the
window next door, and saw Matilda go out and come
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes!&rdquo; repeated the policeman. &ldquo;Quite long
enough for some ruffian to come in and fling her over the
stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who would do it?&rdquo; asked Matilda, looking up at
him with her poor pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the question; that&rsquo;s what we must find out,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
said Knapp. &ldquo;Was the kitchen just as it was when you
left it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;except that she had put the bread and cheese on
the table. And the glasses, and knives,&rdquo; added the girl,
looking round at the said table, which remained as we had
found it, &ldquo;but not the plates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, to go to something else: Did she bring her
work-basket downstairs with her from the bedroom when she
remarked to you that she would go and put the supper on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. She left the basket on the chair in front of her
where it had been standing. She just got up and shook the
threads from off her gown, and went on down. When I left
the room the basket was there; I saw it. And I think,&rdquo;
added the girl, with a great sob, &ldquo;I think that while laying
the supper she must have gone upstairs again to fetch the
basket, and must have fallen against the banisters with fright,
and overbalanced herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fright at what?&rdquo; asked Knapp.</p>

<p>Matilda shivered. Susan whispered to him that they
were afraid at night of seeing the ghost of Mr. Edmund
Peahern.</p>

<p>The man glanced keenly at Matilda for a minute. &ldquo;Did
you ever see it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;But there are strange noises, and
we think it is in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Knapp, coughing to hide a comical smile,
&ldquo;ghosts don&rsquo;t tear pieces out of gowns&mdash;that ever I heard of.
I should say it was something worse than a ghost that has
been here to-night. Had this poor girl any sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Matilda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except Owen the milkman.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>A red streak flashed into Matilda&rsquo;s cheeks. I knew Owen:
he was Mrs. Blair&rsquo;s milkman also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Owen must be your sweetheart or hers,&rdquo; went on
Knapp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him, often enough, talking and laughing
with you both when bringing the afternoon&rsquo;s milk round.
Ten minutes at a stretch he has stayed in this garden, when
he need not have been as many moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been no harm: and it&rsquo;s nothing to anybody,&rdquo;
said Matilda.</p>

<p>The key of the front door was searched for, high and low;
but it could not be found. Whoever locked the door, must
have made off with the key. But for that, and for the
evidences of the scuffle above and the pieces torn out of the
gown, we should have thought Matilda&rsquo;s opinion was correct:
that Jane Cross had gone upstairs for her basket, and through
some wretched accident had pitched over the balustrades.
Matilda could not relinquish the notion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only a week ago that ever was&mdash;a week ago this
very day&mdash;that Jane Cross nearly fell over there. We were
both running upstairs, trying in sport which should get first
into our bedroom; and, in jostling one another on the landing,
she all but overbalanced herself. I caught hold of her
to save her. It&rsquo;s true&mdash;if it were the last word I had to
speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matilda broke down, with a dreadful fit of sobbing. Altogether
she struck me as being about as excitable a young
woman as one could meet in a summer day&rsquo;s journey.</p>

<p>Nothing more could be made out of it this evening. Jane
Cross had met her death, and some evil or other must have
led to it. The police took possession of the house for the
night: and Matilda, out of compassion, was brought to ours.
To describe the Mater&rsquo;s shock and Mary Blair&rsquo;s, when they
heard the news, would be beyond me.</p>

<p>All sorts of conjectures arose in the neighbourhood. The
most popular belief was that some person must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
perceived the front door open, and, whether with a good or a
bad intention, entered the house; that he must have stolen
upstairs, met Jane Cross on the top landing, and flung her
down in a scuffle. That he must then have let himself out
at the front door and locked it after him.</p>

<p>Against this theory there were obstacles. From the time
of Matilda&rsquo;s leaving the house till her return, certainly not
more than ten minutes had elapsed, perhaps not quite as
much, and this was a very short space of time for what had
been done in it. Moreover the chances were that I, sitting
at the next window, should have seen any one going in or
out; though it was not of course certain. I had got up once
to ring the bell, and stayed a minute or two away from the
window, talking with Mary Blair and the Mater.</p>

<p>Some people thought the assassin (is it too much to call
him so?) had been admitted by Jane Cross herself; or he
might have been in hiding in the garden before she locked
the door. In short, the various opinions would fill a
volume.</p>

<p>But suspicion fell chiefly upon one person&mdash;and that was
Thomas Owen the milkman. Though, perhaps, &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo;
is too strong a word to give to it&mdash;I ought rather to say
&ldquo;doubt.&rdquo; These Owens were originally from Wales, very
respectable people. The milk business was their own; and,
since the father&rsquo;s death, which happened only a few months
before, the son had carried it on in conjunction with his
mother. He was a young man of three or four and twenty,
with a fresh colour and open countenance, rather superior in
manners and education. The carrying out the milk himself
was a temporary arrangement, the boy employed for it
being ill. That he had often lingered at No.&nbsp;7, laughing
with the two young women, was well known; he had also
been seen to accost them in the street. Only the previous
day, he and Matilda had stayed talking in the churchyard
after morning service when everybody else had left it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he had walked up nearly as far as Seaboard Terrace with
Jane Cross in the evening. A notion existed that he had
entered the house on the Monday evening, for who else was
it likely to have been, cried everybody. Which was, of
course, logic. At last a rumour arose&mdash;arose on the Tuesday&mdash;that
Owen had been <em>seen</em> to leave the house at dusk on the
fatal evening; that this could be proved. If so, it looked
rather black. I was startled, for I had liked the man.</p>

<p>The next day, Wednesday, the key was found. A gardener
who did up the gardens of the other end house, No.&nbsp;1, every
Wednesday, was raking the ground underneath some dwarf
pines that grew close against the front railings, and raked out
a big door-key. About a dozen people came rushing off with
it to No.&nbsp;7.</p>

<p>It was the missing key. It fitted into the door at once,
locked and unlocked it. When the villain had made his way
from the house after doing the mischief, he must have flung
the key over amidst the pines, thinking no doubt it would lie
hidden there.</p>

<p>The coroner and jury assembled; but they could not make
more of the matter than we had made. Jane Cross had died
of the fall down the well-staircase, which had broken her
neck; and it was pretty evident she had been flung down.
Beyond the one chief and fatal injury, she was not harmed
in any way; not by so much as a scratch. Matilda, whose
surname turned out to be Valentine, having got over the first
shock, gave her testimony with subdued composure. She
was affected at parts of it, and said she would have saved
Jane Cross&rsquo;s life with her own: and no one could doubt that
she spoke the truth. She persisted in asserting her opinion
that there had been no scuffle, in spite of appearances; but
that the girl had been terrified in some way and had accidentally
fallen over.</p>

<p>When Matilda was done with, Thomas Owen took her
place. He was all in black, having dressed himself to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to the inquest and wearing mourning for his father; and I
must say, looking at him now, you&rsquo;d never have supposed he
carried out milk-pails.</p>

<p>Yes, he had known the poor young woman in question, he
readily said in answer to questions; had been fond of chaffing
with the two girls a bit, but nothing more. Meant nothing
by it, nothing serious. Respected both of them; regarded
them as perfectly well-conducted young women.&mdash;Was either
of them his sweetheart? Certainly not. Had not courted
either of them. Never thought of either of them as his future
wife: should not consider a servant eligible for that position&mdash;at
least, his mother would not. Of the two, he had liked
Jane Cross the best. Did not know anything whatever of
the circumstances attending the death; thought it a most
deplorable calamity, and was never more shocked in his life
than when he heard of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any truth in the report that you were at the house
on Monday evening?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no truth in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see him come out o&rsquo; No.&nbsp;7: I see him come out o&rsquo; the
side door in the garden wall,&rdquo; burst forth a boy&rsquo;s earnest
voice from the back of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw me <em>not</em> come out of it,&rdquo; quietly replied Thomas
Owen, turning round to see who it was that had spoken.
&ldquo;Oh, it is you, is it, Bob Jackson! Yes, you came running
round the corner just as I turned from the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>were</em> there, then?&rdquo; cried the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. At the door, yes; that&rsquo;s true enough; but I
was not inside it. What happened was this: on Monday I
had some business at a farmhouse near Munpler, and set out
to walk over there early in the evening. In passing down the
side road by No.&nbsp;7, I saw the two maids at the top window.
One of them&mdash;I think it was Jane Cross&mdash;called out to ask
me in a joking kind of way whether I was about to pay them
a visit; I answered, not then, but I would as I came back if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
they liked. Accordingly, in returning, I rang the bell. It
was not answered, and I rang again with a like result. Upon
that, I went straight home to my milk books, and did not
stir out again, as my mother can prove. That is the
truth, sir, on my oath; and the whole truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time was this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure. It was getting dusk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of the young women this second
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or hear anything?&mdash;Any noise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever. I supposed that they would not come
to the door to me because it was late: I thought nothing
else. I declare, sir, that this is all I know of the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause when he concluded. Knapp, the
policeman, and another one standing by his side, peered at
Owen from under their eyebrows, as if they did not put
implicit faith in his words: and the coroner recalled Matilda
Valentine.</p>

<p>She readily confirmed the statement of his having passed
along the side road, and Jane Cross&rsquo;s joking question to him.
But she denied having heard him ring on his return, and
said the door-bell had not rung at all that night. Which
would seem to prove that Owen must have rung during the
time she had gone out for the beer.</p>

<p>So, you perceive, the inquest brought forth no more available
light, and had to confess itself baffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine termination this is to our pleasure,&rdquo; cried the
Squire, gloomily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like mysteries, Johnny. And of
all the mysteries I have come across in my life, the greatest
mystery is this at No.&nbsp;7.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE MYSTERY AT NUMBER SEVEN</h2>


<h3>II.&mdash;OWEN, THE MILKMAN</h3>

<p>It was a grand sea to-day: one of the grandest that we had
seen at Saltwater. The waves were dancing and sparkling
like silver; the blue of the sky was deeper than a painter&rsquo;s
ultramarine. But to us, looking on it from Mrs. Blair&rsquo;s
house in Seaboard Terrace, its brightness and beauty were
dimmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you see, Johnny,&rdquo; observed the Squire to me, his
face and tone alike gloomy&mdash;outward things take their
impress from the mind&mdash;&ldquo;with that dreadful affair at the
next door jaundicing one&rsquo;s thoughts, the sea might as well
be grey as blue, and the sky lowering with thunder-clouds.
I repeat that I don&rsquo;t like mysteries: they act on me like a
fit of indigestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affair just was a mystery; to us, as to all Saltwater.
More than a week had elapsed since the Monday evening
when it took place, and poor Jane Cross now lay buried in
the windy graveyard. On this said Monday evening, the two
servant maids, Jane Cross and Matilda Valentine (left in the
house, No.&nbsp;7, Seaboard Terrace, during the absence of the
family abroad), had been pursuing their ordinary occupations.
While Jane Cross was laying the cloth for supper in the
kitchen, Matilda went out to fetch the usual pint of ale.
On her return she could not get in. When admittance
was obtained, Jane Cross lay dead in the hall, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fallen down the well of the staircase. Evidences of a scuffle
on the upper landing could be traced, making it apparent
that the fall was not accidental; that she had been flung
down. Some doubt attached to Owen, the milkman,
partly from his previous intimacy with the girls, chiefly
because he had been seen leaving the back door of the
house somewhere about the time it must have occurred.
What Owen said was, that he had rung twice at the door,
but his ring was not answered.</p>

<p>Matilda was to be pitied. The two young women had
cared a good deal for one another, and the shock to Matilda
was serious. The girl, now staying in our house, had worn
a half-dazed look ever since, and avoided No.&nbsp;7 as though it
had the plague. Superstition in regard to the house had
already been rife in both the servants&rsquo; minds, in consequence
of the unhappy death in it of their master&rsquo;s son, Edmund
Peahern, some weeks back: and if Matilda had been afraid
of seeing one ghost before (as she had been) she would now
undoubtedly expect to see two of them.</p>

<p>On this same morning, as I stood with the Squire looking
at the sea from the drawing-room window of No.&nbsp;6, Matilda
came in. Her large dark eyes had lost their former sparkle,
her clear olive skin its freshness. She asked leave to speak
to Mrs. Todhetley: and the Mater&mdash;who sat at the table
adding up some bills, for our sojourn at Saltwater was drawing
towards its close&mdash;told her, in a kindly tone, to speak on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am making bold to ask you, ma&rsquo;am, whether you could
help me to find a place in London,&rdquo; began Matilda, standing
between the door and the table in her black dress. &ldquo;I
know, ma&rsquo;am, you don&rsquo;t live in London, but a long way off
it; Mrs. Blair has told me so, Master Johnny Ludlow also:
but I thought perhaps you knew people there, and might be
able to hear of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mater looked at Matilda without answering, and then
round at us. Rather strange it was, a coincidence in a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
way, that we had had a letter from London from Miss
Deveen that morning, which had concluded with these lines
of postscript: &ldquo;Do you chance to know of any nice,
capable young woman in want of a situation? One of my
housemaids is going to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally this occurred to the Mater&rsquo;s mind when Matilda
spoke. &ldquo;What kind of situation do you wish for?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As housemaid, ma&rsquo;am, or parlour-maid. I can do my
duty well in either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now, my girl,&rdquo; spoke up the Squire, turning from
the window, &ldquo;why need you leave Saltwater? You&rsquo;d never
like London after it. This is a clear, fresh, health-giving
place, with beautiful sands and music on them all day long;
London is nothing but smoke and fogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matilda shook her head. &ldquo;I could not stay here, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, girl. Of course what has happened <em>has</em>
happened, and it&rsquo;s very distressing; and you, of all people,
must feel it so: but you will forget it in time. If you don&rsquo;t
care to go back to No.&nbsp;7 before Mr. and Mrs. Peahern come
home&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never go back to No.&nbsp;7, sir,&rdquo; she interrupted, a
vehemence that seemed born of terror in her subdued
voice. &ldquo;Never in this world. I would rather die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said the Squire, impatiently.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with No.&nbsp;7. What has
happened in it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an unlucky house, sir; a haunted house,&rdquo; she contended
with suppressed emotion. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s true that I
would rather die outright than go back to live in it; for the
terror of being there would slowly kill me. And so, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
she added quickly to Mrs. Todhetley, evidently wishing to
escape the subject, &ldquo;I should like to go away altogether
from Saltwater; and if you can help me to hear of a place
in London, I shall be very grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will consider of it, Matilda,&rdquo; was the answer. And
when the girl had left the room the Mater asked us what we
thought about recommending her to Miss Deveen. We
saw no reason against it&mdash;not but that the Squire put the
girl down as an idiot on the subject of haunted houses&mdash;and
Miss Deveen was written to.</p>

<p>The upshot was, that on the next Saturday Matilda bade
farewell to Saltwater and departed for Miss Deveen&rsquo;s, the
Squire sarcastically assuring her that <em>that</em> house had no
ghosts in it. We should be leaving, ourselves, the following
Tuesday.</p>

<p>But, before that day came, it chanced that I saw Owen,
the milkman. It was on the Sunday afternoon. I had
taken little Joe Blair for a walk across the fields as far
as Munpler (their Montpellier-by-Sea, you know), and in
returning met Thomas Owen. He wore his black Sunday
clothes, and looked a downright fine fellow, as usual. There
was something about the man I could not help liking, in
spite of the doubt attaching to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Matilda Valentine is gone, sir,&rdquo; he observed, after
we had exchanged a few sentences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she went yesterday,&rdquo; I answered, putting my back
against the field fence, while young Joe went careering about
in chase of a yellow butterfly. &ldquo;And for my part, I don&rsquo;t
wonder at the girl&rsquo;s not liking to stay at Saltwater. At
least, in Seaboard Terrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told this morning that Mr. and Mrs. Peahern were
on their way home,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most likely they are. They&rsquo;d naturally want to look
into the affair for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I hope with all my heart they will be able to get
some light out of it,&rdquo; returned Owen, warmly. &ldquo;I mean
to do <em>my</em> best to bring out the mystery, sir; and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
rest till it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words were fair, his tone was genuine. If it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
indeed himself who had been the chief actor in the tragedy,
he carried it off well. I hardly knew what to think. It is
true I had taken a bit of a fancy to the man, according to
my usual propensity to take a fancy, or the contrary; but I
did not know much about him, and not anything of his
antecedents. As he spoke to me now, his tone was marked,
rather peculiar. It gave me a notion that he wanted to
say more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea that you will be able to trace
it out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my own sake I should like to get the matter cleared
up,&rdquo; he added, not directly answering my question. &ldquo;People
are beginning to turn the cold shoulder my way: one woman
asked me to my face yesterday whether I did it. No, I
told her, I did not do it, but I&rsquo;d try and find out who did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure you heard and saw nothing suspicious that
night when you rang the bell and could not get in, Owen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not then, sir; no. I saw no light in the house and
heard no noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not any clue to go by, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, sir, yet. But I can&rsquo;t help thinking somebody
else has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda!&rdquo; I repeated, in amazement. &ldquo;Surely you can&rsquo;t
suspect that she&mdash;that she was a party to any deed so cruel
and wicked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir, I don&rsquo;t mean that; the young women were
too good friends to harm one another: and whatever took
place, took place while Matilda was out of the house. But
I can&rsquo;t help fancying that she knows, or suspects, more of
the matter than she will say. In short, that she is screening
some one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To me it seemed most unlikely. &ldquo;Why do you judge so,
Owen?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By her manner, sir. Not by much else. But I&rsquo;ll tell
you something that I saw. On the previous Wednesday
when I left the afternoon milk at that tall house just beyond
Seaboard Terrace, the family lodging there told me to call
in the evening for the account, as they were leaving the
next day. Accordingly I went; and was kept waiting so
long before they paid me that it was all but dark when I
came out. Just as I was passing the back door at No.&nbsp;7,
it was suddenly drawn open from the inside, and a man
stood in the opening, whispering with one of the girls. She
was crying, for I heard her sobs, and he kissed her and
came out, and the door was hastily shut. He was an ill-looking
man; so far at least as his clothes went; very
shabby. His face I did not see, for he pulled his slouching
round hat well over his brows as he walked away rapidly,
and the black beard he wore covered his mouth and chin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of the maids was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. The next day I chaffed them a bit
about it, but they both declared that nobody had been
there but the watchmaker, Mr. Renninson, who goes every
Wednesday to wind up the clocks, and that it must have
been him I saw, for he was late that evening. I said no
more; it was no business of mine; but the man I saw go
out was just about as much like Renninson as he was
like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you fancy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please wait a minute, sir,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
finished. Last Sunday evening, upon getting home after
service, I found I had left my prayer-book in church. Not
wishing to lose it, for it was the one my father always used,
I went back for it. However, the church was shut up, so
I could not get in. It was a fine evening, and I took a
stroll round the churchyard. In the corner of it, near to
Mr. Edmund Peahern&rsquo;s tomb, they had buried poor Jane
Cross but two days before&mdash;you know the spot, sir. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on the flat square of earth that covers her grave, stood
Matilda Valentine, the greatest picture of distress you can
imagine, tears streaming down her cheeks. She dried her
eyes when she saw me, and we came away together.
Naturally I fell to talking of Jane Cross and the death. &lsquo;I
shall do as much as lies in my power to bring it to light,&rsquo; I
said to Matilda; &lsquo;or people may go on doubting me to the
end. And I think the first step must be to find out who
the man was that called in upon you the previous Wednesday
night.&rsquo; Well, sir, with that, instead of making any answering
remark as a Christian would, or a rational being, let us say,
Matilda gives a smothered shriek and darts away out of the
churchyard. I couldn&rsquo;t make her out; and all in a minute
a conviction flashed over me, though I hardly know why,
that she knew who was the author of the calamity, and was
screening him; or at any rate that she had her suspicions,
if she did not actually know. And I think so still, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head, not seeing grounds to agree with Owen.
He resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning, between nine and ten, I was in the
shop, putting a pint of cream which had been ordered into
a can, when to my surprise Matilda walked in, cool and
calm. She said she had come to tell me that the man I
had seen leave the house was her brother. He had fallen
into trouble through having become security for a fellow
workman, had had all his things sold up, including his tools,
and had walked every step of the way&mdash;thirty miles&mdash;to ask
her if she could help him. She did help him as far as she
could, giving him what little money she had by her, and
Jane Cross had added ten shillings to it. He had got
in only at dusk, she said, had taken some supper with
them, and left again afterwards, and that she was letting
him out at the gate when I must have been passing it. She
did not see me, for her eyes were dim with crying: her
heart felt fit to break in saying farewell. That was the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
she declared, and that her brother had had no more to do
with Jane&rsquo;s death than she or I had; he was away again
out of Saltwater the same night he came into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well? Did you not believe her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Owen, boldly. &ldquo;I did not. If this
was true, why should she have gone off into that smothered
shriek in the churchyard when I mentioned him, and rush
away in a fright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not tell. Owen&rsquo;s words set me thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know which of the two girls it was who let the
man out that Wednesday night, for I did not clearly see;
but, sir, the impression on my mind at the moment was,
that it was Jane Cross. Jane Cross, and not Matilda. If
so, why does she tell me this tale about her brother, and
say it was herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if it was Jane Cross?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Owen shook his head. &ldquo;All sorts of notions occur to
me, sir. Sometimes I fancy that the man might have been
Jane&rsquo;s sweetheart, that he might have been there again on
the Monday night, and done the mischief in a quarrel; and
that Matilda is holding her tongue because it is her brother.
Let the truth be what it will, Matilda&rsquo;s manner convinces
me of one thing: that there&rsquo;s something she is concealing,
and that it is half frightening her wits out of her.&mdash;&mdash;You are
going to leave Saltwater, I hear, sir,&rdquo; added the young man
in a different tone, &ldquo;and I am glad to have the opportunity
of saying this, for I should not like you to carry away any
doubt of me. I&rsquo;ll bring the matter to light if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touching his hat, he walked onwards, leaving my thoughts
all in a whirligig.</p>

<p>Was Owen right in drawing these conclusions?&mdash;or was
he purposely giving a wrong colouring to facts, and seeking
craftily to throw suspicion off himself? It was a nice
question, one I could make neither top nor tail of. But,
looking back to the fatal evening, weighing this point, sifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that, I began to see that Matilda showed more anxiety,
more terror, than she need have shown <em>before</em> she knew that
any ill had happened. Had she a prevision, as she stood
at the door with the jug of ale in her hand, that some evil
might have chanced? Did she leave some individual in
the house with Jane Cross when she went to the Swan to
get the ale?&mdash;and was it her brother? Did she leave <strong>Owen</strong>
in the house, and was she screening him?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Matilda! Is it you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was fourteen months later, and autumn weather, and
I had just arrived in London at Miss Deveen&rsquo;s. My
question to Matilda, who came into my dressing-room with
some warm water to wash off the travelling dust, was not
made in surprise at seeing <em>her</em>, for I supposed she was still
in service at Miss Deveen&rsquo;s, but at seeing the change in her.
Instead of the healthy and, so to say, handsome girl known
at Saltwater, I saw a worn, weary, anxious-looking shadow,
with a feverish fire in her wild dark eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been ill, Matilda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not at all. I am quite well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have grown very thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the London air, sir. I think everybody must get
thin who lives in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very civilly and respectfully, but yet with an unmistakable
air of reticence, spoke she. Somehow the girl was changed,
and greatly changed. Perhaps she had been grieving after
Jane Cross? Perhaps the secret of what had happened (if
in truth Matilda knew it) lay upon her with too heavy
a weight?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you find Matilda a good servant?&rdquo; I asked of Miss
Deveen, later, she and I being alone together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very good servant, Johnny. But she is going to
leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Deveen only nodded, in answer to the first query,
passing over the last. I supposed she did not wish to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think her so much altered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In looks: looks and manner. She is just a shadow.
One might say she had passed through a six months&rsquo; fever.
And what a curious light there is in her eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has always impressed me with the idea of having
some great care upon her. None can mistake that she is a
sorrowful woman. I hear that the other servants accuse her
of having been &lsquo;crossed in love,&rsquo;&rdquo; added Miss Deveen,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is thinner even than Miss Cattledon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that, I daresay you think, need not be, Johnny!
Miss Cattledon, by the way, is rather hard upon Matilda
just now: calls her a &lsquo;demon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A demon! Why does she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. Though it is only a little domestic
matter, one that perhaps you will hardly care to hear. You
must know (to begin with) that Matilda has never made
herself sociable with the other servants here; in return they
have become somewhat prejudiced against her, and have
been ready to play her tricks, tease her, and what not. But
you must understand, Johnny, that I knew nothing of the state
of affairs below; such matters rarely reach me. My cook,
Hall, was especially at war with Matilda: in fact, I believe
there was no love lost between the two. The girl&rsquo;s melancholy&mdash;for
at times she does seem very melancholy&mdash;was
openly put down by the rest to the assumption that she
must have had some love affair in which the swain had
played her false. They were continually worrying her on
this score, and it no doubt irritated Matilda; but she rarely
retorted, preferring rather to leave them and take refuge in
her room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why could they not let her alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;People can&rsquo;t let one another alone, as I believe, Johnny.
If they did, the world would be pleasanter to live in than
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose Matilda got tired at last, and gave
warning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Some two or three weeks ago it appears that, by
some means or other, Hall obtained access to a small trunk;
one that Matilda keeps her treasures in, and has cautiously
kept locked. If I thought Hall had opened this trunk with
a key of her own, as Matilda accuses her of doing, I would
not keep the woman in my house another day. But she
declares to me most earnestly&mdash;for I had her before me
here to question her&mdash;that Matilda, called suddenly out of
her chamber, left the trunk open there, and the letter, of
which I am about to tell you, lying, also open, by its side.
Hall says that she went into the room&mdash;it adjoins her own&mdash;for
something she wanted, and that all she did&mdash;and she
admits this much&mdash;was to pick up the letter, carry it downstairs,
read it to the other servants, and make fun over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What letter was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strictly speaking, it was only part of a letter: one begun
but not concluded. It was in Matilda&rsquo;s own hand, apparently
written a long time ago, for the ink was pale and
faded, and it began &lsquo;Dearest Thomas Owen. The&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Owen!&rdquo; I exclaimed, starting in my chair.
&ldquo;Why, that is the milkman at Saltwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who he is, Johnny, and I don&rsquo;t
suppose it matters. Only a few lines followed, three or
four, speaking of some private conversation that she had
held with him on coming out of church the day before, and
of some reproach that she had then made to him respecting
Jane Cross. The words broke suddenly off there, as if the
writer had been interrupted. But why Matilda did not
complete the letter and send it, and why she should have
kept it by her all this time, must be best known to herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane Cross was her fellow-servant at Mr. Peahern&rsquo;s.
She who was killed by falling down the staircase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor thing, I remembered the name. But, to go
on. In the evening, after the finding of this letter, I and
Miss Cattledon were startled by a disturbance in the kitchen.
Cries and screams, and loud, passionate words. Miss
Cattledon ran down; I stayed at the top of the stairs. She
found Hall, Matilda, and one of the others there, Matilda
in a perfect storm of fury, attacking Hall like a maniac.
She tore handfuls out of her hair, she bit her thumb until
her teeth met in it: Hall, though by far the bigger person
of the two, and I should have thought the stronger, had no
chance against her; she seemed to be as a very reed in her
hands, passion enduing Matilda with a strength perfectly
unnatural. George, who had been out on an errand, came
in at the moment, and by his help the women were parted.
Cattledon maintains that Matilda, during the scene, was
nothing less than a demon; quite mad. When it was over,
the girl fell on the floor utterly exhausted, and lay like
a dead thing, every bit of strength, almost of life, gone out
of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never could have believed it of Matilda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I, Johnny. I grant that the girl had just cause to
be angry. How should we like to have our private places
rifled, and their contents exhibited to and mocked at by
the world; contents which to us seem sacred? But to have
put herself into that wild rage was both unseemly and unaccountable.
Her state then, and her state immediately
afterwards, made me think&mdash;I speak it with all reverence,
Johnny&mdash;of the poor people in holy writ from whom the
evil spirits were cast out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. It seems to be just such a case, Miss Deveen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s thumb was so much injured that a doctor had to
come daily to it for nine or ten days,&rdquo; continued Miss
Deveen. &ldquo;Of course, after this climax, I could not retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Matilda in my service; neither would she have remained in
it. She indulged a feeling of the most bitter hatred to the
women servants, to Hall especially&mdash;she had not much
liked them before, as you may readily guess&mdash;and she said
that nothing would induce her to remain with them, even
had I been willing to keep her. So she has obtained a
situation with some acquaintances of mine who live in this
neighbourhood, and goes to it next week. That is why
Matilda leaves me, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In my heart I could not help being sorry for her, and said
so. She looked so truly, terribly unhappy!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for her,&rdquo; assented Miss Deveen. &ldquo;And
had I known the others were making her life here uncomfortable,
I should have taken means to stop their pastime.
Of the actual facts, with regard to the letter, I cannot be at
any certainty&mdash;I mean in my own mind. Hall is a respectable
servant, and I have never had cause to think her
untruthful during the three years she has lived with me:
and she most positively holds to it that the little trunk was
standing open on the table and the letter lying open beside
it. Allowing that it was so, she had, of course, no right
to touch either trunk or letter, still less to take the letter
downstairs and exhibit it to the others, and I don&rsquo;t defend
her conduct: but yet it is different from having rifled the
lock of the trunk and taken the letter out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Matilda accuses her of doing that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: and, on her side, holds to it just as positively.
What Matilda tells me is this: On that day it chanced that
Miss Cattledon had paid the women servants their quarter&rsquo;s
wages. Matilda carried hers to her chamber, took this said
little trunk out of her large box, where she keeps it, unlocked
it and put the money into it. She disturbed nothing in the
trunk; she says she had wrapped the sovereigns in a bit of
paper, and she just slipped them inside, touching nothing
else. She was shutting down the lid when she heard herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
called to by me on the landing below. She waited to lock
the box but not to put it up, leaving it standing on the
table. I quite well remembered calling to the girl, having
heard her run upstairs. I wanted her in my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Deveen paused a minute, apparently thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda has assured me again and again that she is
quite sure she locked the little trunk, that there can be no
mistake on that point. Moreover, she asserts that the letter
in question was lying at the bottom of the trunk beneath
other things, and that she had not taken it out or touched
it for months and months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when she went upstairs again&mdash;did she find the
little trunk open or shut?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says she found it shut: shut and locked just as she
had left it; and she replaced it in her large box, unconscious
that any one had been to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she long in your room, Miss Deveen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, the best part of an hour. I wanted a
little sewing done in a hurry, and told her to sit down there
and then and do it. It was during this time that the cook,
going upstairs herself, saw the trunk, and took the opportunity
to do what she did do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I should feel inclined to believe Matilda. Her
tale sounds the more probable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, Johnny. I can hardly believe that a
respectable woman, as Hall undoubtedly is, would deliberately
unlock a fellow-servant&rsquo;s box with a false key.
Whence did she get the key to do it? Had she previously
provided herself with one? The lock is of the most simple
description, for I have seen the trunk since, and Hall might
possess a key that would readily fit it: but if so, as the
woman herself says, how could she know it? In short,
Johnny, it is one woman&rsquo;s word against another&rsquo;s: and,
until this happened, I had deemed each of them to be
equally credible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>To be sure there was reason in that. I sat thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were it proved to have been as Matilda says, still I
could not keep her,&rdquo; resumed Miss Deveen. &ldquo;Mine is a
peaceable, well-ordered household, and I should not like
to know that one, subject to insane fits of temper, was a
member of it. Though Hall in that case would get her
discharge also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the people where Matilda is going know why she
leaves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. and Miss Soames. Yes. I told them all about it.
But I told them at the same time, what I had then learnt&mdash;that
Matilda&rsquo;s temper had doubtlessly been much tried here.
It would not be tried in their house, they believed, and
took her readily. She is an excellent servant, Johnny, let
who will get her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not resist the temptation of speaking to Matilda
about this, an opportunity offering that same day. She
came into the room with some letters just left by the
postman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought my mistress was here, sir,&rdquo; she said, hesitating
with the tray in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Deveen will be here in a minute: you can leave
the letters. So you are going to take flight, Matilda! I
have heard all about it. What a silly thing you must be to
put yourself into that wonderful tantrum!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She broke into my box, and turned over its contents,
and stole my letter to mock me,&rdquo; retorted Matilda, her
fever-lighted eyes taking a momentary fierceness. &ldquo;Who,
put in my place, would not have gone into a tantrum, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she says she did not break into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As surely as that is heaven&rsquo;s sun above us, she <em>did it</em>,
Mr. Johnny. She has been full of spite towards me for
a long time, and she thought she would pay me out. I did
but unlock the box, and slip the little paper of money in,
and I locked it again instantly and brought the key away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with me: I can never say anything truer than that, sir: to
make a mistake about it is not possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No pen could convey the solemn earnestness with which
she spoke. Somehow it impressed me. I hoped Hall would
get served out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the wrong has triumphed for once. As far as I
can see, sir, it often does triumph. Miss Deveen thinks
great things of Hall, but she is deceived in her; and I daresay
she will find her out sometime. It was Hall who ought
to have been turned away instead of me. Not that I would
stay here longer if I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you like Miss Deveen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much indeed, sir; she is a good lady and a kind
mistress. She spoke very well indeed of me to the new
family where I am going, and I daresay I shall do well
enough there.&mdash;Have you been to Saltwater lately, sir?&rdquo;
she added, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never since. Do you get news from the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I have never heard a word from
any soul in it. I have written to nobody, and nobody has
written to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And nothing more has come out about poor Jane Cross.
It is still a mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And likely to be one,&rdquo; she replied, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. Do you know what Owen the milkman
thought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had spoken the last sentence or two with her eyes
bent, fiddling with the silver waiter. Now they were raised
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owen thought that you could clear up the mystery if
you liked, Matilda. At least, that you possessed some clue
to it. He told me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owen as good as said the same to me before I left,&rdquo;
she replied, after a pause. &ldquo;He is wrong, sir: but he must
think it if he will. Is he&mdash;is he at Saltwater still?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For all I know to the contrary. This letter, that the
servants here got at, was one you were beginning to write to
Owen. Did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not talk of that letter, Mr. Johnny: my
private affairs concern myself only,&rdquo; she interrupted&mdash;and
went out of the room like a shot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Had anyone told me that during this short visit of mine
in London I should come across the solution of the mystery
of that tragedy enacted at No.&nbsp;7, I might have been slow to
credit it. Nevertheless, it was to be so.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed, in going through life, that events
seem to carry a sequence in themselves almost as though
they bore in their own hands the guiding thread that
connects them from beginning to end? For a time this
thread will seem to be lost; to lie dormant, as though it had
snapped, and the course of affairs it was holding to have
disappeared for good. But lo! up peeps a little end when
least expected, and we catch hold of it, and soon it grows
into a handful; and what we had thought lost is again full
of activity and gradually works itself out. Not a single
syllable, good or bad, had we heard of that calamity at
Saltwater during the fourteen months which had passed
since. The thread of it lay dormant. At Miss Deveen&rsquo;s
it began to steal up again: Matilda, and her passion, and
the letter she had commenced to Thomas Owen were to the
fore: and before that visit of mine came to an end, the
thread had, strange to say, unwound itself.</p>

<p>I was a favourite of Miss Deveen&rsquo;s: you may have
gathered that from past papers. One day, when she was
going shopping, she asked me to accompany her and not
Miss Cattledon: which made that rejected lady&rsquo;s face all
the more like vinegar. So we set off in the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we going to Regent Street, Miss Deveen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day, Johnny. I like to encourage my neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
tradespeople, and shall buy my new silk here. We have
excellent shops not far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few intricate turnings and windings, the carriage
stopped before a large linendraper&rsquo;s, which stood amidst a
colony of shops nearly a mile from Miss Deveen&rsquo;s. George
came round to open the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what will you do, Johnny?&rdquo; said Miss Deveen.
&ldquo;I daresay I shall be half an hour in here, looking at silks
and calico; and I won&rsquo;t inflict that penalty on you. Shall
the carriage take you for a short drive the while, or will you
wait in it?&mdash;or walk about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wait in the street here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and come in to
you when I am tired. I like looking at shops.&rdquo; And I do
like it.</p>

<p>The next shop to the linendraper&rsquo;s was a carver and
gilder&rsquo;s: he had some good pictures displayed in his window;
at any rate, they looked good to me: and there I took
up my station to begin with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, sir? Have you forgotten me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words came from a young man who stood at the next
door, close to me, causing me to turn quickly to him from
gazing at the pictures. No, I had not forgotten him. I
knew him instantly. It was Owen, the milkman.</p>

<p>After a few words had passed, I went inside. It was a
large shop, well fitted up with cans and things pertaining to
a milkman&rsquo;s business. The window-board was prettily set
off with moss, ferns, a bowl containing gold and silver fish,
a miniature fountain, and a rush basket of fresh eggs. Over
the door was his own name, Thomas Owen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are living here, Owen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why have you left Saltwater?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, Mr. Johnny, the place looked askance at me.
People, in their own minds, set down that miserable affair at
No.&nbsp;7 to my credit. Once or twice I was hooted at by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
street boys, asking what I had done with Jane Cross. My
mother couldn&rsquo;t stand that, and I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, so we
just sold our business at Saltwater, and bought this one here.
And a good change it has been, in a pecuniary point of view:
this is an excellent connection, and grows larger every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first, mother couldn&rsquo;t bear London: she longed for
the country air and the green fields: but she is reconciled
to it now. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll have an opportunity soon
of going back to see her own old Welsh mountains, and of
staying there if it pleases her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I should say you are going to be married,
Owen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed and nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wish me good luck,
won&rsquo;t you, sir? She&rsquo;s the only daughter at the next door, the
grocer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will. Have you discovered anymore of that
mysterious business, Owen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Saltwater? No, sir: not anything at all that could
touch the matter itself. But I have heard a good bit that
bears upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you still suspect that Matilda could tell if she
chose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect more than that, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s words were curiously significant. He had a
bit of fern in his hand, and his fresh, open, intelligent face
was bent downwards, as if he wanted to see what the leaf
was made of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure, sir. It is but suspicion at the best: but
it&rsquo;s an uncommonly strong one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me what you mean? You may trust
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure I may,&rdquo; he said, promptly. &ldquo;And I think
I will tell you&mdash;though I have never breathed it to mortal
yet. I think Matilda did it herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Backing away from the counter in my surprise, I upset an
empty milk-can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda!&rdquo; I exclaimed, picking up the can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnny, with all my heart I believe it to have been
so. I have believed it for some time now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the girls were too friendly to harm one another. I
remember you said so yourself, Owen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought so then, sir. No suspicion of Matilda
had occurred to me, but rather of the man I had seen there
on the Wednesday. I think she must have done it in a
sudden passion; not of deliberate purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now, what are your reasons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you, sir, as I daresay you can recall to mind, that
I should do what lay in my power to unravel the mystery&mdash;for
it was not at all agreeable to have it laid at my door. I
began, naturally, with tracing out the doings of that night as
connected with No.&nbsp;7. Poor Jane Cross had not been out
of doors that night, and so far as I knew had spoken to no
one save to me from the window; therefore of her there
seemed nothing to be traced: but of Matilda there was.
Inquiring here and there, I bit by bit got a few odds and
ends of facts together. I traced out the exact time, almost
to a minute, that I rang twice at the door-bell at No.&nbsp;7, and
was not answered; and the time that Matilda entered the
Swan to get the supper beer. Pretty nearly half an hour had
elapsed between the first time and the second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half an hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not far short of it. Which proved that Matilda must
have been indoors when I rang, though she denied it before
the coroner, and it was taken for granted that I had rung
during her absence to fetch the beer. And you knew, sir,
that her absence did not exceed ten minutes. Now why did
not Matilda answer my ring? Why did she not candidly say
that she had heard the ring, but did not choose to answer it?
Well, sir, that gave rise to the first faint doubt of her: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
when I recalled and dwelt on her singular manner, it appeared
to me that the doubt might pass into grave suspicion. Look
at her superstitious horror of No.&nbsp;7. She never would go
into the house afterwards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two or three other little things struck me, all tending to
strengthen my doubts, but perhaps they are hardly worth
naming. Still, make the worst of it, it was only suspicion,
not certainty, and I left Saltwater, holding my tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is this all, Owen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite, sir. Would you be so good as to step
outside, and just look at the name over the grocer&rsquo;s
door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did so, and read Valentine. &ldquo;John Valentine.&rdquo; The
same name as Matilda&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is,&rdquo; Owen said, in answer to me. &ldquo;After
settling here we made acquaintance with the Valentines, and
by-and-by learnt that they are cousins of Matilda&rsquo;s. Fanny&mdash;my
wife that is to be&mdash;has often talked to me about
Matilda; they were together a good bit in early life; and by
dint of mentally sifting what she said, and putting that and
that together, I fancy I see daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matilda&rsquo;s father married a Spanish woman. She was of
a wild, ungovernable temper, subject to fits of frenzy; in one
of which fits she died. Matilda has inherited this temper;
she is liable to go into frenzies that can only be compared to
insanity. Fanny has seen her in two only; they occur at
rare intervals; and she tells me that she truly believes the
girl is mad&mdash;mad, Mr. Johnny&mdash;during the few minutes that
they last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The history I had heard of her mad rage at Miss Deveen&rsquo;s
flashed over me. Temporarily insane they had thought her
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said to Fanny one day when we were talking of her,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
resumed Owen, &ldquo;that a person in that sort of uncontrollable
passion, might commit any crime; a murder, or what not.
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Fanny replied, &lsquo;and not unlikely to do it, either:
Matilda has more than once said that she should never die
in her bed.&rsquo; Meaning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo; I asked, for he came to a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, meaning, I suppose, that she might sometime
lay violent hands upon herself, or upon another. I can&rsquo;t
help thinking that something must have put her into one of
these rages with Jane Cross, and that she pushed or flung the
poor girl over the stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking back, rapidly recalling signs and tokens, I thought
it might have been so. Owen interrupted me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall come across her sometime, Mr. Johnny. These
are things that don&rsquo;t hide themselves for ever: at least, not
often. And I shall tax her with it to her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know where she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t sir. I wish I did. It was said that she
came up to take a situation in London, and perhaps she is
still in it. But London&rsquo;s a large place, I don&rsquo;t know what
part of it she was in, and one might as well look for a needle
in a bundle of hay. The Valentines have never heard of her
at all since she was at Saltwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How strange it seemed;&mdash;that she and they were living so
near one another, and yet not to be aware of it. Should I
tell Owen? Only for half a moment did the question cross
me. <em>No</em>: most certainly not. It might be as he suspected;
and, with it all, I could only pity Matilda. Of all unhappy
women, she seemed the unhappiest.</p>

<p>Miss Deveen&rsquo;s carriage bowled past the door to take her
up at the linendraper&rsquo;s. Wishing Owen good-day, I was
going out, but drew back to make room for two people who
were entering: an elderly woman in a close bonnet, and a
young one with a fair, pretty and laughing face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother and Fanny, sir,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very pretty, very nice, Owen,&rdquo; I said, impulsively.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure to be happy with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir; I think I shall. I wish you had
spoken a word or two to her, Mr. Johnny: you&rsquo;d have seen
how nice she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay now, Owen. I&rsquo;ll come again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not even to Miss Deveen did I speak of what I had
heard. I kept thinking of it as we drove round Hyde Park,
and she told me I was unusually silent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The thread was unwinding itself more and more. Once
it had begun to lengthen, I suppose it had to go on.
Accident led to an encounter between Matilda and Thomas
Owen. Accident? No, it was this same thread of destiny.
There&rsquo;s no such thing as accident in the world.</p>

<p>During the visit to the linendraper&rsquo;s, above spoken of,
Miss Deveen bought a gown for Matilda. Feeling in her
own heart sorry for the girl, thinking she had been somewhat
hardly done by in her house, what with Hall and the
rest of them, she wished to make her a present on leaving,
as a token of her good-will. But the quantity of stuff
bought proved not to be sufficient: Miss Deveen had
doubted the point when it was cut off, and told Matilda to
go herself and get two yards more. This it was, this simple
incident, that led to the meeting with Owen. And I was
present at it.</p>

<p>The money-order office of the district was situated amidst
this colony of shops. In going down there one afternoon to
cash an order, I overtook Matilda. She was on her way to
buy the additional yards of stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am going right, sir?&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know much about this neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not know much about it! What, after having lived in
it more than a year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have hardly ever gone out; except to church on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Sunday,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And what few articles I&rsquo;ve
wanted in the dress line, I have mostly bought at the little
draper&rsquo;s shop round the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had the words left her lips, when we came face to
face with Thomas Owen. Matilda gave a sort of smothered
cry, and stood still, gazing at him. What they said to one
another in that first moment, I did not hear. Matilda had a
frightened look, and was whiter than death. Presently we
were all walking together towards Thomas Owen&rsquo;s, he having
invited Matilda to go and see his home.</p>

<p>But there was another encounter first. Standing at the
grocer&rsquo;s door was pretty Fanny Valentine. She and Matilda
recognized each other, and clasped hands. It appeared to
me that Matilda did it with reluctance, as though it gave her
no pleasure to meet her relatives. She must have known
how near they lived to Miss Deveen&rsquo;s, and yet she had
never sought them out. Perhaps the very fact of not wishing
to see them had kept her from the spot.</p>

<p>They all sat down in the parlour behind the shop&mdash;a neat
room. Mrs. Owen was out; her son produced some wine.
I stood up by the bookcase, telling them I must be off the
next minute to the post-office. But the minutes passed, and
I stayed on.</p>

<p>How he led up to it, I hardly know; but, before I was
prepared for anything of the kind, Thomas Owen had
plunged wholesale into the subject of Jane Cross, recounting
the history of that night, in all its minute details, to Fanny
Valentine. Matilda, sitting back on the far side of the room
in an armchair, looked terror-stricken: her face seemed to
be turning into stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you begin about that, Thomas Owen?&rdquo; she
demanded, when words at length came to her. &ldquo;It can
have nothing to do with Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been wishing to tell it her for some little time,
and this seems to be a fitting opportunity,&rdquo; he answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
coolly resolute. &ldquo;You, being better acquainted with the
matter than I, can correct me if I make any blunders. I
don&rsquo;t care to keep secrets from Fanny: she is going to be
my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matilda&rsquo;s hands lifted themselves with a convulsive
movement and fell again. Her eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Your wife?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have no objection,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My dear old
mother goes into Wales next month, and Fanny comes here
in her place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a cry, faint and mournful as that of a wounded
dove, Matilda put her hands before her face and leaned
back in her chair. If she had in truth loved Thomas Owen,
if she loved him still, the announcement must have caused
her cruel pain.</p>

<p>He resumed his narrative; assuming as facts what he had
in his own mind conceived to have been the case, and by
implication, but not directly, charging Matilda with the
crime. It had a dreadful effect upon her; her agitation
increased with every word. Suddenly she rose up in the
chair, her arms lifted, her face distorted. One of those fits
of passion had come on.</p>

<p>We had a dreadful scene. Owen was powerful, I of not
much good, but we could not hold her. Fanny ran sobbing
into her own door and sent in two of the shopmen.</p>

<p>It was the climax in Matilda Valentine&rsquo;s life. One that
perhaps might have been always looked for. From that
hour she was an insane woman, her ravings interspersed
with lucid intervals. During one of these, she disclosed the
truth.</p>

<p>She had loved Thomas Owen with a passionate love.
Mistaking the gossip and the nonsense that the young man
was fond of chattering to her and Jane Cross, she believed
her love was returned. On the day preceding the tragedy,
when talking with him after morning service, she had taxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
him with paying more attention to Jane Cross than to herself.
Not a bit of it, he had lightly answered; he would take her
for a walk by the seashore that evening if she liked to go.
But, whether he had meant it, or not, he never came, though
Matilda dressed herself in readiness. On the contrary, he
went to church, met Jane there, and walked the best part of
the way home with her. Matilda jealously resented this;
her mind was in a chaos; she began to suspect that it was
Jane Cross he liked, not herself. She said a word or two
upon the subject to Jane Cross the next day, Monday;
but Jane made sport of it&mdash;laughed it off. So the time
went on to evening, when they were upstairs together, Jane
sewing, Matilda writing. Suddenly Jane Cross said that
Thomas Owen was coming along, and Matilda ran to the
window. They spoke to him as he passed, and he said he
would look in as he returned from Munpler. After Matilda&rsquo;s
letter to her brother was finished, she began a note to
Thomas Owen, intending to reproach him with not keeping
his promise to her and for joining Jane Cross instead. It
was the first time she had ever attempted to write to him;
and she stuck her work-box with the lid open behind the
sheet of paper that Jane Cross might not see what she was
doing. When it grew dusk, Jane Cross remarked that it was
blind man&rsquo;s holiday and she would go on down and lay
the supper. In crossing the room, work-basket in hand, she
passed behind Matilda, glanced at her letter, and saw the
first words of it, &ldquo;Dearest Thomas Owen.&rdquo; In sport, she
snatched it up, read the rest where her own name was mentioned,
and laughingly began, probably out of pure fun, to
teaze Matilda. &ldquo;Thomas Owen your sweetheart!&rdquo; she
cried, running out on to the landing. &ldquo;Why, he is mine.
He cares more for my little finger than for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Poor
girl! She never finished her sentence. Matilda, fallen into
one of those desperate fits of passion, had caught her up
and was clutching her like a tiger-cat, tearing her hair, tearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
pieces out of her gown. The scuffle was brief: almost in an
instant Jane Cross was falling headlong down the well of the
staircase, pushed over the very low balustrades by Matilda,
who threw the work-basket after her.</p>

<p>The catastrophe sobered her passion. For a while she
lay on the landing in a sort of faint, all strength and power
taken out of her as usual by the frenzy. Then she went
down to look after Jane Cross.</p>

<p>Jane was dead. Matilda, not unacquainted with the
aspect of death, saw that at once, and her senses pretty
nearly deserted her again with remorse and horror. She
had never thought or wished to kill Jane Cross, hardly to
harm her, she liked her too well: but in those moments of
frenzy she had not the slightest control over her actions.
Her first act was to run and lock the side door in the garden
wall, lest anyone should come in. How she lived through
the next half-hour, she never knew. Her superstitious fear
of seeing the dead Edmund Peahern in the house was
strong&mdash;and now there was another! But, with all her
anguish and her fear, the instinct of self-preservation was
making itself heard. What must she do? How could she
throw the suspicion off herself? She could not run out of
the house and say, &ldquo;Jane Cross has fallen accidentally over
the stairs; come and look to her&rdquo;&mdash;for no one would have
believed it to be an accident. And there were the pieces,
too, she had clutched out of the gown! Whilst thus
deliberating the gate-bell rang, putting her into a state of
the most intense terror. It rang again. Trembling, panting,
Matilda stood cowering in the kitchen, but it did not ring a
third time. This was, of course, Thomas Owen.</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. Something she
<em>must</em> do, and her brain hastily concocted the plan she
should adopt. Putting the cloth and the bread and cheese
on the table, she took the jug and went out at the front
door to fetch the usual pint of ale. A moment or two she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
stood at the front door, peering up and down the road to
make sure that no one was passing. Then she slipped out,
locking the door softly; and, carrying the key concealed in
the hollow of her hand, she threw it amidst the shrubs at
No 1. <em>Now</em> she could not get into the house herself; she
would not have entered it alone for the world: people must
break it open. All along the way to the post-office, to
which she really did go, and then to the Swan, she was
mentally rehearsing her tale. And it succeeded in deceiving
us all, as the reader knows. With regard to the visit of her
brother on the Wednesday, she had told Thomas Owen the
strict truth; though, when he first alluded to it in the churchyard,
her feelings were wrought up to such a pitch that she
could only cry out and escape. But how poor Matilda
contrived to live on and carry out her invented story, how
she bore the inward distress and repentance that lay upon
her, we shall never know. A distress, remorse, repentance
that never quitted her, night or day; and which no doubt
contributed to gradually unhinge her mind, and throw it
finally off its balance.</p>

<p>Such was the true history of the affair at No.&nbsp;7, which had
been so great a mystery to Saltwater. The truth was never
made public, save to the very few who were specially
interested in it. Matilda Valentine is in an asylum, and
likely to remain there for life; whilst Thomas Owen and his
wife flourish in sunshine, happy as a summer day is long.</p>

<h2>CARAMEL COTTAGE</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;EDGAR RESTE</h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was early in August, and we were at Dyke Manor, for the
Squire had let us go home from school for the Worcester
races. We had joined him at Worcester the previous day,
Tuesday, driving home with him in the evening. To-morrow,
Thursday, he would drive us over to the course again; to-day,
Wednesday, the horses would have rest; and on Friday
we must return to school.</p>

<p>Breakfast was over, the Squire gone out, and the few
minutes&rsquo; Bible-reading to us&mdash;which Mrs. Todhetley never
forgot, though Tod did not always stay in for it, but he did
this morning&mdash;came to an end. Hannah appeared at the
door as she closed the Book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Barbary&rsquo;s come, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, my dear,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Todhetley to Lena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said Lena, running to the open window
instead, and nearly pitching head-foremost through it: upon
which Hannah captured her and carried her off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who on earth is Miss Barbary?&rdquo; questioned Tod. &ldquo;Any
relation to the man at Caramel Cottage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His daughter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley. &ldquo;She comes to
teach Lena French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope she&rsquo;s less of a shady character than her father!&rdquo;
was Tod&rsquo;s free comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A year or two before this, a stranger had made his appearance
at Church Dykely, and put up at the Silver Bear. He
was a gentlemanly-looking man of perhaps forty years, tall,
slender, agile, with thin, distinguished features, an olive skin,
black hair, and eyes of a peculiar shade of deep steel-blue.
People went into raptures over his face, and called it beautiful.
And so it was; but to my thinking it had a look in it
that was the opposite of beautiful; any way, the opposite of
good. They said it was my fancy at home: but Duffham
owned to the same fancy. His name, as he wrote it down
one day at the Silver Bear, was Pointz Barbary. After a
week&rsquo;s stay at the inn, he, finding, I suppose, that the neighbourhood
suited him, looked out for a little place to settle
down upon, and met with it in Caramel Cottage, a small
dwelling near to us, on the property called Caramel&rsquo;s Farm.
The cottage was then to be let, and Mr. Barbary went
into it.</p>

<p>Some items of his past history came out by degrees; it is
hard to say how, for he told none himself. Now and then
some former friend or other came to pay him a short visit;
and it may be that these strangers talked about him.</p>

<p>Pointz Barbary, a gentleman by descent, and once of fairly
good substance, had been a great traveller, had roved pretty
nearly all over the world. The very few relatives he possessed
lived in Canada&mdash;people of condition, it was said&mdash;and his
own property (what was left of it) was also there. He had
been married twice. First to a young lady in France; her
friends (English) having settled there for economy&rsquo;s sake.
She died at the end of the year, leaving him a little girl, that
the mother&rsquo;s people at once took to. Next he married a
Miss Reste, daughter of Colonel Reste, in her Majesty&rsquo;s
service. A few years later she also died&mdash;died of consumption&mdash;leaving
him a widower and childless. It&rsquo;s true
he had his first wife&rsquo;s daughter, but she lived in France with
her mother&rsquo;s sister, so he did not get much benefit from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Barbary was poor. No mistake about that. The
interest of his first wife&rsquo;s money brought him in fifty-two
pounds yearly, and this he would enjoy till his death, when
it went to his daughter. Miss Reste had brought him several
thousand pounds; but he and she had lived away, and not
a stiver remained of it. His own means had also been spent
lavishly; and, so far as was known, he had but the two and
fifty pounds a year to live upon at Caramel Cottage, with a
chance remittance from Canada now and again.</p>

<p>He made no acquaintance at Church Dykely, and none
was made with him. Civilly courteous in a rather grand and
haughty way when he met people, so far as a few remarks
went, touching the weather or the crops, and similar safe
topics, he yet kept the world at a distance. As the time went
on it was thought there might be a reason for this. Whispers
began to circulate that Mr. Barbary&rsquo;s doings were not orthodox.
He was suspected of poaching, both in game and fish,
and a strong feeling of shyness grew up against him.</p>

<p>Some few months prior to the present time&mdash;August&mdash;his
daughter came to Caramel Cottage. Her aunt in France
was dead, and she had no home henceforth but her father&rsquo;s.
That I and Tod had not seen or heard of her until now, was
owing to the midsummer holidays having been spent at Crabb
Cot. The vacation over, and Mrs. Todhetley back at Dyke
Manor, she found herself called upon by Miss Barbary.
Hearing that Mrs. Todhetley wished her little girl to begin
French, she had come to offer herself as teacher. The upshot
was that she was engaged, and came for a couple of
hours every morning to drill French into Lena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo; asked Tod of the mother, upon her
explaining this. &ldquo;Long and thin and dark, like Barbary, and
disagreeable with a self-contained reticence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not the least like him in any way,&rdquo; was Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s
answer. &ldquo;She is charmingly simple&mdash;good, I am
sure, and one of the most open-natured girls I ever met. &lsquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wish to do it for the sake of earning a little money,&rsquo; she said
to me, when asking to come. &lsquo;My dear father is not rich,
and if I can help him in ever so small a way I shall be thankful.&rsquo;
The tears almost came into her eyes as she spoke,&rdquo;
added Mrs. Todhetley; &ldquo;she quite won my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems to think great things of that respectable parent
of hers!&rdquo; commented Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Whatever may be the truth as to his failings,
<em>she</em> sees none in him. And, my dears, better that it should
be so. She earns a little money of me, apart from teaching
Lena,&rdquo; added Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What at?&rdquo; asked Tod. &ldquo;Teaching <em>you</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother shook her head with a smile. &ldquo;I found out,
Joseph, that she is particularly skilful at mending old lace.
I have some that needs repairing. She takes it home and
does it at her leisure&mdash;and you cannot imagine how grateful
she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nineteen&mdash;close upon twenty, I think she said,&rdquo; replied
the mother. And there the conversation ended, for Mrs.
Todhetley had to go to the kitchen to give the daily
orders.</p>

<p>The morning wore on. We went to Church Dykely and
were back again by twelve o&rsquo;clock. Tod had got Don on
the lawn, making him jump for biscuit, when the dog rushed
off, barking, and we heard a scream. A young lady in a
straw hat and a half-mourning cotton dress was running away
from him, she and Lena having come out of the house
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Don,&rdquo; said Tod in his voice of authority,
which the good Newfoundland dog never disobeyed. &ldquo;How
dare you, sir? Johnny, lad, I suppose that&rsquo;s Miss Barbary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about her. A charming girl, as the
mother had said, slight and graceful, with a face like a peach
blossom, dimpled cheeks, soft light-brown hair and dark-blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
eyes. Not the hard, steel-blue eyes that her father had:
sweet eyes, these, with a gentle, loving look in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid of the dog,&rdquo; cried Tod, advancing
to where she stood, behind the mulberry tree. &ldquo;Miss Barbary,
I believe?&rdquo;&mdash;lifting his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said in a frank tone, turning her frank face to
him; &ldquo;I am Katrine Barbary. It is a very large dog&mdash;and
he barks at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Large he was, bigger than many a small donkey. A brave,
faithful, good-tempered dog, he, and very handsome, his curly
white coat marked out with black. Gentle to friends and respectable
strangers, Don was at mortal enmity with tramps and
beggars: we could not cure him of this, so he was chained up
by day. At night he was unchained to roam the yard at will,
but the gate was kept locked. Had he got out, he might have
pinned the coat of any loose man he met, but I don&rsquo;t believe he
would have bitten him. A good fright Don would give, but not
mortal injury. At least, we had never yet known him to do that.</p>

<p>Lena ran up in her short pink frock, her light curls flying.
&ldquo;Miss Barbary is always afraid when she hears Don bark,&rdquo;
she said to us. &ldquo;She will not go near the yard; she thinks
he&rsquo;ll bite her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will teach you how to make friends with him,&rdquo; said Tod:
&ldquo;though he would never hurt you, Miss Barbary. Come
here and pat his head whilst I hold him; call him by his
name gently. Once he knows you, he would protect you
from harm with his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She complied with ready obedience, though the roses left
her cheeks. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Tod, loosing the dog, and letting
her pat him at leisure, &ldquo;see how gentle he is; how affectionately
he looks up at you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please not to think me very silly!&rdquo; she pleaded earnestly,
as though beseeching pardon for a sin. &ldquo;I have never been
used to dogs. We do not keep dogs in France. At least
very few people do. Oh dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Something that she carried in her left hand wrapped in
paper had dropped on to the lawn. Don pounced upon it.
&ldquo;Oh, please take it from him! please, please!&rdquo; she cried in
terror. Tod laughed, and extricated the little parcel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has some valuable old lace in it of Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
she explained as she thanked him. &ldquo;I am taking it home to
mend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mend old lace famously, I hear,&rdquo; said Tod, as we
walked with her to the entrance gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I do it nearly as well as the nuns who
taught me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been in a convent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for my education. I was an externe&mdash;a daily pupil.
My aunt lived next door to it. I went every morning at
eight o&rsquo;clock and returned home at six in the evening to
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get no dinner?&rdquo; asked Tod.</p>

<p>She took the question literally. &ldquo;I had dinner and collation
at school; breakfast and supper at home. That was the
way in our town with the externes at the convent. We were
Protestants, you see, so my aunt liked me to be at home on
Sundays. Thank you for teaching Don to know me: and
now I will say good morning to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was holding the gate open for her to pass out, when Ben
Gibbon went by, a gun carelessly held over his shoulder. He
touched his hat to us, and we gave him a slight nod in reply.
Miss Barbary said &ldquo;Good day, Mr. Gibbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod drew down his displeased lips. He had already taken
a liking to the girl&mdash;so had I, for that matter&mdash;she was a true
lady, and Mr. Ben Gibbon, a brother to the gamekeeper at
Chavasse Grange, could not boast of a particularly shining
character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know <em>him</em>, Miss Barbary?&rdquo; asked Tod. &ldquo;Be
quiet, Don!&rdquo; he cried to the dog, which had begun to growl
when he saw Gibbon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He comes to our house sometimes to see papa. Please
pardon me for keeping you waiting,&rdquo; she added to me, as I
still held back the gate. &ldquo;That gun is pointed this way and
it may go off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod was amused. &ldquo;You seem to dread guns as much as
you dread dogs, Miss Barbary. I will walk home with you,&rdquo;
he said, as she at last came through, the gun having got to
a safe distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she was beginning, and then stopped in
confusion, blushing hotly, and looking at both of us. &ldquo;I
should like it; but&mdash;&mdash;would it be proper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proper!&rdquo; echoed Tod, staring, and then bursting into
a fit of laughter long and loud. &ldquo;Oh dear! why, Miss
Barbary, you must be French all over! Johnny, you can
come, too. Lena, run back again; you have not any hat on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crossing the road to take the near field way, we went
along the path that led beside the hedge, and soon came in
view of Caramel Cottage; it was only a stone&rsquo;s throw, so to
say, from our house. An uncommonly lonely look it had,
buried there amidst many trees, with the denser trees of the
Grove close beyond it. We asked her whether she did not
find it dull here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first I did, very; I do still a little: it is so different
from the lively town I have lived in, where we knew all the
people, and they knew us. But we shall soon be more
lively,&rdquo; she resumed, after a pause. &ldquo;A cousin is coming to
stay with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Is it a lady or a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a gentleman&mdash;Edgar Reste. He is not my
cousin by kin; not really related to me; but papa says he
will be as my cousin, as my brother even, and that he is
very nice. Papa&rsquo;s last wife was Miss Reste, and he is her
nephew. He is a barrister in London, and he has been
much overworked, and he is coming here to-morrow for rest
and country air.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the low green gate of the little front garden of
Caramel Cottage stood Mr. Barbary, in his brown velveteen
shooting coat and breeches of the same, that became him
and his straight lithe limbs so well. Every time I saw him
the beauty of his face struck me afresh; but so did the
shifty expression of his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s papa!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, her dimples lighting
up. &ldquo;And&mdash;why, there&rsquo;s a gentleman with him&mdash;a stranger!
I wonder who it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw him as he came from the porch down the narrow
garden-path. A slight, slender young man of middle height
and distinguished air, with a pale, worn, nice-looking face,
and laughing, luminous dark brown eyes. Yes, I saw
Edgar Reste for the first time at this his entrance at
Caramel Cottage, and it was a thing to be thankful for that
I could not then foresee the nameless horror his departure
from it (I may as well say his disappearance) was to shadow
forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Mr. Barbary to us, courteously
civil. &ldquo;Katrine, here&rsquo;s a surprise for you: your cousin is
come. Edgar, this is my little girl.&mdash;Mr. Reste,&rdquo; he added,
by way of introduction generally.</p>

<p>Mr. Reste lifted his hat, bowed slightly, and then turned
to Katrine with outstretched hand. She met it with a hot
blush, as if strange young men did not shake hands with her
every day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not expect you quite so soon,&rdquo; she gently said,
to atone for her first surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But I felt unusually out of sorts
yesterday, and thought it would make no difference to
Mr. Barbary whether I came to-day or to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice had a musical ring; his manner was open and
honest. He might be Pointz Barbary&rsquo;s nephew by marriage,
but I am sure he was not by nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll fall in love with one another, those two; you&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
see,&rdquo; said Tod to me as we went home. &ldquo;Did you mark
his pleased face when he spoke to her, Johnny&mdash;and how
she blushed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, Tod! they tell me I am fanciful. What
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not fanciful with your fancies, lad. As to you,
Mr. Don&rdquo;&mdash;turning to the dog, which had done nothing but
growl while we stood before Barbary&rsquo;s gate, &ldquo;unless you
mend your manners, you shall not come out again. What
ails you, sir, to-day?&rdquo;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>If love springs out of companionship, why then, little
wonder that it found its way into Caramel Cottage. They
were with each other pretty nearly all day and every day,
that young man and that young woman; and so&mdash;what else
was to be expected?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must try and get you strong again,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbary
to his guest, who at first, amidst other adverse symptoms,
could eat nothing. No matter what dainty little dish old
Joan prepared, Mr. Reste turned from it.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary had taken to old Joan with the house. A
little, dark, active woman, she, with bright eyes and a mob-cap
of muslin. She was sixty years old; quick, capable,
simple and kindly. We don&rsquo;t get many such servants now-a-days.
One defect Joan had&mdash;deafness. When a voice
was close to her, it was all right; at a distance she could
not hear it at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long is it that you have been ailing, Cousin
Edgar?&rdquo; asked Miss Barbary, one day when they were
sitting together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, some few weeks, Cousin Katrine,&rdquo; he answered in a
tone to imitate hers&mdash;and then laughed. &ldquo;Look here, child,
don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;Cousin Edgar!&rsquo; For pity&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you are not my true cousin,&rdquo; she said, blushing
furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that. If we were the nearest cousins that can
be, it would still be silly.&rdquo; Objectionable, was the word
he had all but used. &ldquo;It is bad taste; has not a nice sound
to cultivated ears&mdash;as I take it. I am Edgar, if you please;
and you are Katrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In France we say &lsquo;mon cousin,&rsquo; or &lsquo;ma cousine,&rsquo; when
speaking to one,&rdquo; returned Katrine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we are not French; we are English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she resumed, as her face cooled down&mdash;&ldquo;why did
you not take rest before? and what is it that has made you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head thoughtfully. The parlour window,
looking to the front, was thrown up before them. A light
breeze tempered the summer heat, wafting in sweetness from
the homely flowers and scented shrubs. The little garden
was crowded with them, as all homely gardens were then.
Roses, lilies, columbines, stocks, gillyflowers, sweet peas,
sweet Williams, pinks white and red, tulips, pansies (or as
they were then generally called, garden-gates), mignonette,
bachelor&rsquo;s buttons, and lots of others, sweet or not sweet,
that I can&rsquo;t stay to recall: and clusters of marjoram and
lavender and &ldquo;old-man&rdquo; and sweet-briar, and jessamines
white and yellow, and woodbine, and sweet syringa; and the
tall hollyhock, and ever true but gaudy sunflower&mdash;each and
all flourished there in their respective seasons. Amidst the
grand &ldquo;horticulture,&rdquo; as it is phrased, of these modern days,
it is a pleasure to lose one&rsquo;s self in the memories of these dear
old simple gardens. Sometimes I get wondering if we shall
ever meet them again&mdash;say in Heaven.</p>

<p>They sat there at the open window enjoying the fragrance.
Katrine had made a paper fan, and was gently fluttering it
to and fro before her flushed young face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have burnt the candle at both ends,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Reste. &ldquo;That is what&rsquo;s the matter with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;es,&rdquo; hesitated she, not quite understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At law business all day, and at literary work the best
part of the night, year in and year out&mdash;it has told upon
me, Katrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should you do both?&rdquo; asked Katrine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Oh, because&mdash;because my pocket is a shallow
pocket, and has, moreover, a hole in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not getting briefs showered in upon me as one might
hope my merits deserve&mdash;I know not any young barrister
who does&mdash;I had to supplement my earnings in that line by
something else, and I took to writing. <em>That</em> is up-hill work,
too; but it brings in a few shillings now and again. One
must pay one&rsquo;s way, you know, Katrine, if possible; and
with some of us it is apt to be a rather extravagant way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it with you?&rdquo; she asked, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>was</em>. I squandered money too freely at first. My
old uncle gave me a fair sum to set up with when my
dinners were eaten and I was called; and I suppose I
thought the sum would never come to an end. Ah! we buy
our experience dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will not the old uncle give you more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a stiver&mdash;this long while past. He lives in India,
and writing to ask him does no good. And he is the only
relative left to me in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edgar Reste lifted his eyebrows. &ldquo;Your father is not my
relative, young lady. His late wife was my aunt; my
father&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your father leave you no money, when he died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any. He was a clergyman with a good benefice,
but he lived up to his income and did not save anything.
No, I have only myself to lean on. Don&rsquo;t know whether
it will turn out to be a broken reed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only help you!&rdquo; breathed Katrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are helping me more than I can say,&rdquo; he answered,
impulsively. &ldquo;When with you I have a feeling of rest&mdash;of
peace. And that&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which avowal brought a hot blush again to Miss Katrine&rsquo;s
cheek and a curious thrill somewhere round about her
heart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time went on. Before much of it had elapsed, they
were in love with one another for ever and for ever, with
that first love that comes but once in a lifetime. That is, in
secret; it was not betrayed or spoken of by either of them,
or intended to be. Mr. Reste, Barrister-at-law (and briefless),
could as soon have entertained thoughts of setting up
a coach-and-four, as of setting up a wife. He had not a
ghost of the means necessary at present, he saw not the
smallest chance yet of attaining them. Years and years and
years might go by before that desirable pinnacle in the
social race was reached; and it might never be reached at
all. It would be the height of dishonour, as he considered,
to persuade Katrine Barbary into an engagement, which
might never be fulfilled. How could he condemn her to
wear out her heart and her life and her days in loneliness,
sighing for him, never seeing him&mdash;he at one end of the
world, she at the other? for that&rsquo;s how, lover-like, he
estimated the distance between this and the metropolis.
So he never let a word of his love escape him, and he
guarded his looks, and treated Katrine as his little cousin.</p>

<p>And she? Be you sure, she was as reticent as he. An
inexperienced young maiden, scrupulously and modestly
brought up, she kept her secret zealously. It is true she
could not help her blushes, or the tell-tale thrilling of her
soft voice; but Edgar Reste was not obliged to read them
correctly.</p>

<p>Likely enough he could penetrate, as the weeks wore
on, some of the ins and outs in the private worth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Mr. Barbary. In fact, he <em>did</em> do so. He found that gentleman
rather addicted to going abroad at night when reasonable
people were in bed and asleep. Mr. Barbary gave him his
views upon the subject. Poaching, he maintained, was a
perfectly legitimate and laudable occupation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one to
be proud of, instead of the contrary,&rdquo; he asserted, one
September day, when they were in the gun-room together.
&ldquo;<em>Proud of</em>, Edgar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a gentleman?&rdquo; laughed Mr. Reste, who invariably
made light of the subject. And he glanced at his host
curiously from between his long dark eyelashes and straight,
fine eyebrows; at the dark, passive, handsome face, at the
long slender fingers, busy over the lock of his favourite
gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a gentleman certainly. Why should common men
usurp all its benefit? The game laws are obnoxious laws,
and it behoves us to set them at naught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another amused laugh from Mr. Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who hesitates to do a bit of smuggling?&rdquo; argued the
speaker. &ldquo;Answer me that, Reste. Nobody. Nobody,
from a prince to a peasant, from poor Jack Tar to his superfine
commander, but deems it meritorious to cheat the
Customs. When a man lands here or yonder with a few
contraband things about him, and gets them through safely,
do his friends and acquaintances turn the cold shoulder
upon him? Not a bit of it; they regard it as a fine feather
in his cap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poaching is the same thing. It is also an amusement.
Oh, it is grand fun, Edgar Reste, to be out on a fine night
and dodge the keepers!&rdquo; continued Mr. Barbary, with
enthusiasm. &ldquo;The spice of daring in it, of danger, if you
choose to put it that way, stimulates the nerves like wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite orthodox, though, mon ami.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orthodox be hanged. Stolen pleasures are sweetest, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
we all know. You shall go out with me some night, Edgar,
and judge for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say but I will&mdash;just to look on&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll ensure
my getting back in safety,&rdquo; said the barrister, in a tone that
might be taken for jest or earnest, assent or refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back in safety!&rdquo; came the mocking echo, as if to get
back in safety from midnight poaching were a thing as sure
as the sun. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let a week or two go on; when shooting
first comes in the keepers are safe to be on the alert; and
then I&rsquo;ll choose a night for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I suppose Katrine knows nothing of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary lodged his gun in the corner against the
wainscot, and turned to look at the barrister. &ldquo;Katrine!&rdquo;
he repeated, in surprised reproach. &ldquo;Why, <em>no</em>. And take
care that you don&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Reste nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the most unsuspicious, innocent child in regard
to the ways of the naughty world that I&rsquo;ve ever met with,&rdquo;
resumed Barbary. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she as much as knows
what poaching means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder you should have her here,&rdquo; remarked the
younger man, reflectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I help it? There&rsquo;s nowhere else for her to
be. She is too old to be put to school; and if she were
not, I have not the means to pay for her. It does not
signify; she will never suspect anything,&rdquo; concluded Mr.
Barbary.</p>

<p>Please do not think Caramel Cottage grand enough to
possess a regular &ldquo;gun-room.&rdquo; Mr. Barbary called it so,
because he kept his two guns in it, also his fishing-tackle
and things of that sort. Entering at the outer porch and
over the level door-sill, to the narrow house-passage, the
parlour lay on the left, and was of pretty good size. The
gun-room lay on the right; a little square room with bare
boards, unfurnished save for a deal table, a chair or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and a strong cupboard let into the wall, which the master of
the house kept locked. Behind this room was the kitchen,
which opened into the back yard. This yard, on the kitchen
side, was bounded by dwarf wooden palings, having a low
gate in their midst. Standing at the gate and looking sideways,
you could see the chimneys of Dyke Manor. On the
opposite side, the yard was enclosed by various small outbuildings
and adjuncts belonging to a cottage homestead.
A rain-water barrel stood in the corner by the house; an
open shed next, in which knives were cleaned and garden
tools kept; then came the pump; and lastly, a little room
called the brewhouse, used for washing and brewing, and
for cooking also during the worst heat of summer. A
furnace was built beside the grate, and its floor was paved
with square red bricks. Beyond this yard, quite open to
it, lay a long garden, well filled with vegetables and fruit
trees, and enclosed by a high hedge. Upstairs were three
bed chambers. Mr. Barbary occupied the largest and best,
which was over the parlour; the smaller one over the gun-room
had been assigned to Edgar Reste, both of them
looking front; whilst Katrine&rsquo;s room was above the kitchen,
looking to the yard and the garden. Old Joan slept in a
lean-to loft in the roof. There is a reason for explaining
all this.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>He had looked like a ghost when we went to school after
the races; he looked like a hale, hearty man when we got
home from the holidays at Michaelmas and to eat the
goose. Of course he had had pretty near eight weeks&rsquo; spell
of idleness and country air at Caramel Cottage. To say
the truth, we felt surprised at his being there still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it <em>is</em> longer than I meant to stay,&rdquo; Mr. Reste
admitted, when Tod said something of this, &ldquo;The air
has done wonders for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why longer? The law courts do not open yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thoughts of going abroad. However, that can
stay over for next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had any shooting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t possess a licence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Tod&rsquo;s tongue, as I could well see,
to ask why he did not take out a licence, but he checked
it. This little colloquy was held at the Manor gate on
Saturday, the day after our return. Miss Barbary was
leaving Lena at the usual time, and he had come strolling
across the field to meet her. They went away together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you, Johnny?&rdquo; said Tod, turning to me,
as soon as they were out of hearing. &ldquo;It is a regular
case of over-head-and-ears: cut and dried and pickled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you judge by, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t you!</em> You&rsquo;ll be a muff to the end, lad. Fancy
a fine young fellow like Reste, a man of the world, staying
on at that pokey little place of Barbary&rsquo;s unless he had
some strong motive to keep him there! I dare say he
pays Barbary well for the accommodation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say Barbary could not afford to entertain him
unless he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stops there to make love to her. It must be a
poor look-out, though, for Katrine, pretty little dimpled
girl! As much chance of a wedding, I should say, as of
a blue moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not! Want of funds. I&rsquo;d start for London, if
I were you, Johnny, and set the Thames on fire. A man
must be uncommonly hard up when he lets all the birds
go beside him for want of taking out a licence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were walking onwards slowly, Mr. Reste bending
to talk to her. And of course it will be understood that
a good deal of that which I have said, and am about to say,
is only related from what came to my knowledge later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true that you had meant to go abroad this year?&rdquo;
Katrine was asking him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I once thought of it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have
friends living at Dieppe, and they wanted me to go to
them. But I have stayed on here instead. Another week
of it, ten days perhaps, and then I must leave Worcestershire
and you, Katrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to work, my dear little girl. That is getting in
arrears shamefully. We are told that all work and no
play makes Jack a dull boy; but all play and no work
would have worse results for Jack than dullness. Ah,
Katrine, what a world this might be if we could only do as
we like in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall you come again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps never,&rdquo; he answered, incautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she repeated, her face turning white before she
could hide it from him. It was a great shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katrine, my dear,&rdquo; he said with some emotion, his tones
low and earnest, &ldquo;I could stay at Caramel Cottage for my
whole life and never wish to quit it, unless I carried somebody
else away from it with me. But there are things which a poor
man, a man without money in the present or prospect of it
in the future, may not as much as glance at: he must put
the temptation from him and hold it at arm&rsquo;s length. I had
a dream the other night,&rdquo; he added, after a pause: &ldquo;I
thought I was a Q.C. and stood in my silk, haranguing a
full bench of judges at Westminster&mdash;who listened to me
with attentive suavity. When I awoke I burst out laughing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the contrast it presented to reality?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just at that. If I were only making enough to set up a
snug little nest of a home, though ever so small, it would be&mdash;something:
but I am not. And so, Katrine, you see that
many things I would do I cannot do; cannot even think of.
And there it lies, and there it ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see, Edgar,&rdquo; she answered, softly sighing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you miss me when I am gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some queer feeling took her throat; she could not speak.
Mr. Reste stopped to pick a little pale blue-bell that grew
under the hedge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know how I shall bear with the loneliness
then,&rdquo; she said in answer, seemingly more to herself than to
him, or to the blue sky right before her, on which her eyes
were fixed. &ldquo;And I shall be more afraid when you are no
longer in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning to her in blank surprise.
&ldquo;What are you afraid of, Katrine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it is all so solitary for me.... Old Joan is too
deaf to be talked to much; and papa is either at work in
the garden or shut up in the gun-room, busy with his things.
Please don&rsquo;t laugh at my childishness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had paused, just to get over her embarrassment, the
avowal having slipped from her unwittingly. The fact was,
poor Katrine Barbary had been rudely awakened from her
state of innocent security. Some days back, when in the
cottage hut of Mary Standish, for Katrine liked to go about
and make friends with the people, that ill-doing husband of
Mary&rsquo;s, Jim, chanced to be at home. Jim had just been
had up before the magistrates at Alcester on some suspicion
connected with snares and gins, but there was no certain
proof forthcoming, and he had to be discharged. Katrine
remarked that if she were Jim she should leave off poaching,
which must be a very dreadful thing, and frightfully
hazardous. Mr. Jim replied that it was not a dreadful
thing, nor hazardous either, for them that knew what they
were about, and he referred her to her father for confirmation
of this assertion. One word led to another. Jim
Standish, his ideas loose and lawless, never thought to
hurt the young lady by what he disclosed, for he was kind
enough when he had no motive to be the contrary, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Katrine left the hut, she carried with her the terrible knowledge
that her father was as fond of poaching as the worst
of them. Since then she had lived in a state of chronic terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must be very solitary for you,&rdquo; assented Mr.
Reste in a grave tone, and he had no idea that her answer
was an evasive one, or its lightness put on; &ldquo;but I cannot
help you, Katrine. Should you ever need counsel, or&mdash;or
protection in any way, apply for it to your friends at Dyke
Manor. They seem kind, good people, and would be strong
to aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning in at the little side gate as he spoke, they saw
Mr. Barbary at work in the garden. He was digging up a
plot of ground some seven or eight feet square under the
branches of the summer-apple tree, which grew at this upper
end of the garden, nearly close to the yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he going to plant there, I wonder?&rdquo; listlessly
spoke Mr. Reste, glancing at the freshness of the turned-up
mould.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Winter cabbages, perhaps; but I am sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
returned Katrine. &ldquo;I do not understand the seasons for
planting vegetables as papa does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, as I have just said, was on Saturday. We saw
Mr. Reste and Katrine at church the next day: a place
Barbary did not often trouble with his presence; and
walked with them, on coming out, as far as the two ways
lay. Our people liked the look of Edgar Reste, but had
not put themselves forward to make much acquaintance
with him, on account of Barbary. One Tuesday, when the
Squire was driving to Alcester, he had overtaken Mr. Reste
walking thither to have a look at the market, and he invited
him to a seat in the carriage. They drove in and drove
back together, and had between the times a snack of bread
and cheese at the Angel. The Squire took quite a fancy to
the young barrister, and openly said to him he wished he
was staying anywhere but at Caramel Cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of leaving soon, I hear,&rdquo; said the
Squire, as we halted in a group when parting, on this same
walk from church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about a week,&rdquo; replied Mr. Reste. &ldquo;I may go
on Saturday next; certainly not later than the following
Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you like a drive to Evesham between this and
then?&rdquo; went on the Squire. &ldquo;I am going over there one of
these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall like it very much indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will let you know which day I go. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; answered Mr. Reste, lifting his hat in salute
to us all, as he walked on with Katrine.</p>

<p>Am I lingering over these various trifling details? I
suppose it will seem so. But the truth is, a dreadful part of
the story is coming on (as poor Katrine said of the poaching)
and my pen holds back from it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A day or two had gone on. It was Tuesday morning,
warm and bright with sunshine. Katrine sat in the parlour
at Caramel Cottage, pouring out the coffee at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take some ham, Katrine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, papa; I have no appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No appetite! nonsense!&rdquo; and Mr. Barbary put a slice
of ham on her plate. &ldquo;Do you feel inclined for a walk as
far as Church Leet this morning, Edgar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Reste. &ldquo;About three miles, is
it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three miles across the fields as straight as the crow
flies. I want to see a man who lives there. He&mdash;why,
that&rsquo;s Pettipher coming here!&mdash;the postman,&rdquo; broke off Mr.
Barbary. Letters were not written every day then, and very
few found their way to Caramel Cottage.</p>

<p>Old Joan went to the door, and then came in. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
like a picture. A dark-blue linsey gown down to her ancles,
neat black stockings and low, tied shoes, a check apron, and
a bow of black ribbon perched in front behind the flapping
border of her white muslin mob-cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pettipher says &rsquo;tis for the gentleman,&rdquo; said Joan, putting
the letter, a thick one, on the table by Mr. Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is from Amphlett!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he took it
up, looking at the great sprawling writing. &ldquo;What on earth
has he got to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opening the letter, a roll of bank-notes fell out. Mr.
Reste stared at them with intense curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it your ship come in?&rdquo; asked Katrine gaily: for
he was wont to say he would do this or that when &ldquo;his ship
came home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Katrine; not much chance of that. Let me see
what he says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Reste,&mdash;I enclose you my debt at last. The other
side have come to their senses, and given in, and paid over
to me instalment the first. Thank you, old friend; you
are a good fellow never to have bothered me. Let me
know your movements when you write back; I ask it
particularly. Ever yours, W.&nbsp;A.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never expected that,&rdquo; cried Mr. Reste, as he
read the words aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money lent by you, Edgar?&rdquo; asked Mr. Barbary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; three or four years ago. I had given it up as a
bad job. Never thought he would gain his cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cause? Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Amphlett, of the Artillery, and an old friend
of mine. As to the cause, it was some injustice that his
avaricious relatives involved him in, and he had no resource
but to bring an action. I am glad he has gained it; he is
an honest fellow, no match for them in cunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Reste was counting the notes while he spoke; six of
them for ten pounds each. Katrine happened to look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her father, and was startled at the expression of his face&mdash;at
the grasping, covetous, <em>evil</em> regard he had fixed upon
the notes. She felt frightened, half sick, with some vague
apprehension. Mr. Reste smoothed the notes out one by
one, and laid them open on the breakfast cloth in a little
stack. While doing this, he caught Mr. Barbary&rsquo;s covetous
look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like such a windfall yourself,&rdquo; he said laughingly
to his host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should. For <em>that</em> a man might be tempted to smother
his grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine instinctively shuddered, though the avowal was
given in a half jesting tone. A prevision of evil seized her.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<h2>CARAMEL COTTAGE</h2>


<h3>II.&mdash;DISAPPEARANCE</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>October was setting in beautifully. Some people say it is
the most lovely month in the year when the skies are blue
and genial.</p>

<p>Seated at the breakfast-table at Caramel Cottage that
Tuesday morning, with the window thrown open to the
warm, pleasant air, the small party of three might have
enjoyed that air, but for being preoccupied with their own
reflections. Edgar Reste was thinking of the bank-notes
which the postman had just brought him in Captain
Amphlett&rsquo;s letter; Katrine Barbary sat shrinking from the
vague fear imparted to her by the curious avowal her father
had made in language not too choice, as his covetous eyes
rested on the money: &ldquo;For that, a man might be tempted
to smother his grandmother.&rdquo; While Mr. Barbary had
started instantly up and flung the window higher, as if in the
silence that followed the words, they had struck back upon
himself unpleasantly, and he sought to divert attention from
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grand day for the outlying crops,&rdquo; he remarked, his
lithe, slender form, his pale, perfect features showing out
well in the light of the brilliant morning. &ldquo;But most of the
grain is in, I think. We shall have a charming walk to
Church Leet, Edgar.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Mr. Reste, as he folded the notes
together and placed them in his pocket-book. There were
six of them for £10 each.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Katrine set off for Dyke Manor that
morning as usual, to talk to Lena in French, and teach her
to read it. She stayed luncheon with us. Chancing to say
that her father and his guest were gone to Church Leet,
Mrs. Todhetley kept her.</p>

<p>At four o&rsquo;clock, when Katrine went home, she found they
had returned, and were then shut up in the gun-room.
Katrine could hear the hum of their voices, with now and
again a burst of merry laughter from Edgar Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they had dinner?&rdquo; she enquired of Joan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure they have, Miss Katrine. They got back at
two o&rsquo;clock, and I prepared the dinner at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had lent Katrine that afternoon the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo;&mdash;which
she said she had never read; one could
hardly believe such a thing of an English girl, but I suppose
it was through her having lived over in France. Taking it
into the back garden, she sat down on a rustic bench, one
or two of which stood about. By-and-by Edgar Reste came
out and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you a nice walk to-day?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What a quaint little village
Church Leet is! Hardly to be called a village, though.
Leet Hall is a fine old place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard so. I have not seen it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not seen it! Do you mean to say, Katrine, that you
have never been to Church Leet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Nobody has ever invited me to go, and I
cannot walk all that way by myself, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was sitting sideways, his left arm leaning on the elbow
of the bench, his kindly, luminous brown eyes fixed on her
fair pretty face, all blushes and dimples. Ah, if fortune had
but smiled upon him!&mdash;if he might but have whispered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
this young girl, who had become so dear to him, of the love
that filled his whole heart!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you walk over with me one of these fine days
before I leave?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be too far for
you, will it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no. I should like to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the prettiest churchyard you ever saw, to rest
in. And such a quaint little church, covered with ivy. The
Rectory, standing by, is quite a grand mansion in comparison
with the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the church has a history, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, as connected with the people of the Hall and the
Rectory; and with its own chimes, that never played, I
hear, but disaster followed. We will go then, Katrine, some
afternoon between now and Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face fell; she turned it from him. &ldquo;<em>Must</em> you leave
on Saturday, Edgar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear little cousin, yes. Cousins in name, you know
we are, though not in reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did say you might stay until Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, my will would be good to stay till Monday, and
many a Monday after it: but you see, Katrine, I have
neglected my work too long, and I cannot break into
another week. So you must please make the most of me
until Saturday,&rdquo; he added playfully, &ldquo;when I shall take the
evening train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You English do not care to travel on a Sunday, I notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We English! Allow me to remind Mademoiselle that
she is just as much English as are the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good mother instilled all kinds of old-world notions
into me, Katrine. Amongst them was that of never doing
week-day work on a Sunday unless compelled by necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you never work on a Sunday&mdash;at your reviews and
writings, and all that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never. I am sure it would not bring me luck if I did.
Suppose we fix Thursday for walking to Church Leet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do nicely. Unless&mdash;Squire Todhetley invited
you to go with him to Evesham one day, you know,&rdquo; broke
off Katrine. &ldquo;He may just fix upon Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case we will take our walk on Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence ensued. Their hearts were very full, and that
makes speech reticent. Katrine glanced now and again at
the pages of the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo; which lay in her lap,
but she did not read it. As to the barrister, he was looking
at her; at the face that had become so dear to him. They
might never meet again, nothing on earth might come of the
present intimacy and the sweet burning longings, but he
knew that he should remember her to the end of time. A
verse of one of Moore&rsquo;s melodies passed through his mind:
unconsciously he began to hum it:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;O, that hallowed form is ne&rsquo;er forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which first love traced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still it, lingering, haunts the greenest spot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On memory&rsquo;s waste.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Joan to say tea is ready,&rdquo; interrupted
Katrine.</p>

<p>They strolled indoors slowly, side by side. The tea-tray
waited in the parlour. Mr. Barbary came in from the gun-room,
and they all sat down to the table.</p>

<p>After tea he went back to the gun-room, Mr. Reste with
him, leaving Katrine alone. She had the candles lighted
and began to mend a piece of Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s valuable old
lace. Presently Joan came in to ask a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Katrine, is it the brace of partridges or the
pheasants that are to be cooked for supper? Do you
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Katrine. &ldquo;But I can ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting down her work, she went to the gun-room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
gently opened the door. Upon which, she heard these
remarkable words from Mr. Reste:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate at all if it were not for the moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moon makes it all the safer,&rdquo; contended Mr.
Barbary. &ldquo;Foes can&rsquo;t rush upon one unawares when the
moon&rsquo;s shining. I tell you this will be one of the best
possible nights for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, papa,&rdquo; hurriedly broke in Katrine, speaking
through the dusk of twilight, &ldquo;is Joan to cook the pheasants
or the partridges?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pheasants,&rdquo; he answered sharply. &ldquo;Shut the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the pheasants were dressed for supper, and very nice
they proved with their bread-sauce and rich gravy. Mr.
Barbary especially seemed to enjoy them; his daughter
did not.</p>

<p>Poor Katrine&rsquo;s senses were painfully alert that night, as
she lay listening after getting to bed. The words she had
overheard in the gun-room seemed to her to bear but one
meaning&mdash;that not only was her father going abroad into
the wilds of danger, but Edgar Reste also. They had gone
to their respective rooms early, soon after she went to hers;
but that might be meant as a blind and told nothing.</p>

<p>By-and-by, she caught a sound as of the stairs creaking.
Mr. Reste and her father were both creeping down them.
Katrine flew to her window and peeped behind the blind.</p>

<p>They went out together by the back door. The bright
moonbeams lay full upon the yard. Mr. Reste seemed to
be attired like her father, in high leggings and a large old
shooting-coat, no doubt borrowed plumes. Each of them
carried a gun, and they stole cautiously out at the little
side gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; moaned the unhappy Katrine, &ldquo;if papa would but
take better care of himself! If he would but leave off doing
this most dreadful and dangerous thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether Katrine fell asleep after that, or not, she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
never decide: it appeared as though but a short time had
elapsed, when she was startled by a sharp sound outside,
close to the house. It might have been the report of a gun,
but she was not sure. This was followed by some stir in
the yard and covert talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are bringing in the game they have shot,&rdquo; thought
Katrine, &ldquo;but oh, I am thankful they have got back safely!&rdquo;
And she put the pillow over her head and ears, and lay
shivering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Squire Todhetley was as good and lenient a man at heart
as could be found in our two counties, Warwickshire and
Worcestershire; fonder of forgiving sins and sinners than of
bringing them to book, and you have not read of him all
these years without learning it. But there was one offence
that stirred his anger up to bubbling point, especially when
committed against himself. And that was poaching.</p>

<p>So that, when we got downstairs to breakfast at Dyke
Manor on the following morning, Wednesday, and were
greeted with the news that some poachers had been out on
our land in the night, and had shot at the keepers, it was no
wonder the Squire went into a state of commotion, and that
the rest of us partook of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, tell Mack to fetch Jones; to bring him here
instantly,&rdquo; fumed he. &ldquo;Those Standishes have been in this
work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went to carry the orders to Mack in the yard. In
passing back, after giving them, I saw that the dog-kennel
was empty and the chain lying loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Don?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Who has taken him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he have strayed out of hisself, Master Johnny,&rdquo;
was Mack&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;He was gone when I come on this
morning, sir, and the gate were standing wide open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone then?&mdash;and the gate open? Where&rsquo;s Giles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, even as I put the question, I caught sight of Giles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at the stable pump, plunging his head and face into a pail
of water. So I knew what had been the matter with <em>him</em>.
Giles was a first-rate groom and a good servant, and it was
very seldom indeed that he took more than was good for
him, but it did happen at intervals.</p>

<p>Old Jones arrived in obedience to the summons, and
stood on his fat gouty legs in the hall while the Squire
talked to him. The faith he put in that old constable was
surprising, whose skill and discernment were about suited to
the year One.</p>

<p>His tale of the night&rsquo;s doings, as confirmed by other tales,
was not very clear. At least, much satisfaction could not
be got out of it. Some poachers congregated on a plot of
land called Dyke&rsquo;s Neck&mdash;why it should have been so
named nobody understood&mdash;were surprised by the keepers
early in the night. A few stray shots were interchanged,
no damage being done on either side, and the poachers
made off, escaping not only scot-free but unrecognised.
This last fact bore the keenest sting of all, and the Squire
paced the hall in a fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must unearth them,&rdquo; he said to Jones: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell
me. They can&rsquo;t have buried themselves, the villains!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to look far for &rsquo;em, Squire,&rdquo; protested Jones.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them jail-birds, the three Standishes. If it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;ll
eat my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why have you not taken up the three Standishes?&rdquo;
retorted the Squire. &ldquo;Of course it is the Standishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your honour, because I can&rsquo;t get at &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said
Jones helplessly. &ldquo;Jim, he is off somewhere; and Dick,
he swears through thick and thin that he was never out of
his bed last night; and t&rsquo;other, Tom, ain&rsquo;t apperiently at
home at all just now. I looked in at their kitchen on my
way here, and that was all I could get out of Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Katrine arrived, preparatory
to her morning&rsquo;s work with Lena. Old Jones and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Squire, still in the hall, were chanting a duet upon the
poachers&rsquo; iniquity, and she halted by me to listen. I was
sitting on the elbow of the carved-oak settle. Katrine
looked pale as a sheet.</p>

<p>Girls, thought I, do not like to hear of these things. For
I knew nothing then of her fears that the offenders had been
her father and Mr. Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the poachers had been taken, sir&mdash;what then?&rdquo; she
said tremblingly to the Squire, in a temporary lull of the
voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then, Miss Barbary? Why then they would have
been lodged in gaol, and the neighbourhood well rid of
them,&rdquo; was the impulsive answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snug and safe, miss,&rdquo; put in old Jones, shuffling on his
gouty legs in his thick white stockings, &ldquo;a-waiting to stand
their trial next spring assizes at Worcester. Which it would
be transportation for &rsquo;em, I hope&mdash;a using o&rsquo; their guns
indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were they known at all?&rdquo; gasped Katrine. &ldquo;And
might not the gamekeepers have shot <em>them</em>? Perhaps have
killed them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Killed &rsquo;em or wounded &rsquo;em, like enough,&rdquo; assented
Jones, &ldquo;and it would be a good riddance of such varmint,
as his worship says, miss. And a misfortin it is that they be
<em>not</em> known. Which is an odd thing to my mind, sir, considering
the lightness o&rsquo; the night: and I&rsquo;d like to find out
whether them there keepers did their duty, or didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the dog anywhere, father,&rdquo; interrupted Tod,
dashing in at this moment in a white heat, for he had been
racing about in search of Don.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, is the dog off?&rdquo; exclaimed old Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;And if those poachers have
stolen him, I&rsquo;ll try and get them hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving us to our commotion, Katrine Barbary passed on
to the nursery with Lena, where the lessons were taken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
This straying away of Don made one of the small calamities
of the day. Giles, put to the torture of confession,
admitted that he remembered unchaining Don the past
night as usual, but could not remember whether or not he
locked the gate. Of course the probability was that he left
it wide open, Mack having found it so in the morning. So
that Mr. Don, finding himself at liberty, might have gone
out promenading as early in the night as he pleased. Giles
was ready to hang himself with vexation. The dog was a
valuable animal; a prize for any tramp or poacher, for he
could be sold at a high price.</p>

<p>We turned out on our different quests; old Jones after the
poachers, I and Tod after Don: and the morning wore on.</p>

<p>Katrine went home at midday. This news of the night
encounter between the keepers and the poachers had thrown
her into a state of anxious pain&mdash;though of course the reader
fully understands that I am, so far, writing of what I knew
nothing about until later. That her father and Edgar Reste
had been the poachers of the past night she could not doubt,
and a dread of the discovery which might ensue lay upon her
with a sick fear. The Standishes might have been included
in the party; more than likely they were; Ben Gibbon also.
Mr. Jim Standish had contrived to let Katrine believe that
they were all birds of a feather, tarred with the same brush.
But how could Edgar Reste have allowed himself to be
drawn into it even for one night? She could not understand
that.</p>

<p>Entering Caramel Cottage by its side gate, Katrine found
Joan seated in the kitchen, slicing kidney beans for dinner.
Her father was in his favourite den, the gun-room, Mr. Reste
was out. When she left in the morning, neither of them
had quitted his respective chamber, an entirely unusual
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How late you are with those beans, Joan!&rdquo; listlessly
observed Katrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The master sent me to the Silver Bear for a bottle of
the best brandy, and it hindered me,&rdquo; explained Joan.
&ldquo;They were having a fine noise together when I got back,&rdquo;
she added, dropping her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were?&rdquo; quickly cried Katrine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The master and Mr. Reste. Talking sharply at one
another, they were, like two savages. I could hear &rsquo;em
through my deafness. Ben Gibbon was here when I went
out, but he&rsquo;d gone when I came in with the brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What with one thing and another, Katrine felt more uncomfortable
than an oyster out of its shell. Mr. Reste
came in at dinner-time, and she saw nothing amiss then,
except that he and her father were both unusually silent.</p>

<p>Afterwards they went out together, and Katrine hoped that
the unpleasantness between them was at an end.</p>

<p>She was standing at the front gate late in the afternoon,
looking up and down the solitary road, which was no better
than a wide field path, when Tod and I shot out of the
dark grove by Caramel&rsquo;s Farm, and made up to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look hot and tired,&rdquo; she said to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would you, Miss Barbary, if you had been scouring
the fields in search of Don, as we have,&rdquo; answered Tod, who
was in a desperate mood.</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Barbary came swinging round the
corner of the short lane that led to the high-road, his guest
following him. They nodded to us and went in at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not happen to have seen anything of our Newfoundland
dog to-day, I suppose, Mr. Barbary?&rdquo; questioned
Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My daughter mentioned
to me that he had strayed away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strayed away or been stolen,&rdquo; corrected Tod. &ldquo;The
dog was a favourite, and it has put my father out more than
you&rsquo;d believe. He thinks the Standishes may have got him:
especially if it is they who were out in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but they have,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbary.</p>

<p>Standing by in silence, I had been wondering what had
come to Mr. Reste. He leaned against the porch, listening
to this, arms folded, brow lowering, face dark, not a bit
like his own pleasant self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am about the neighbourhood a good deal; I&rsquo;ll not
fail to keep a look-out,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbary, as we were turning
away. &ldquo;He was a fine dog, and might prove a temptation
to the Standishes; but I should be inclined to think
it more likely that he has strayed to a distance than that
they have captured him. They might find a difficulty in
concealing a large, powerful dog such as he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not they; they are deep enough for any wicked action,&rdquo;
concluded Tod, as we went onwards.</p>

<p>It was tea-time then at Caramel Cottage, and they sat
down to take it. Mr. Barbary was sociable and talked of
this and that; Edgar Reste spoke hardly a word; Katrine
busied herself with the teapot and cups. At dusk Ben
Gibbon came in, and Katrine was sent to bear Joan company
in the kitchen. Brandy and whisky were put upon
the table, Joan being called to bring in hot and cold water.
They sat drinking, as Katrine supposed, and talking together
in covert tones for two hours, when Gibbon left; upon
which Katrine was graciously told by her father she might
return to the parlour. Her head ached badly, she felt ill at
ease, and when supper was over went up to bed. But she
could not get to sleep.</p>

<p>About eleven o&rsquo;clock, as she judged it to be, loud and
angry sounds arose. Her father and Mr. Reste had renewed
their dispute&mdash;whatever its cause might be. By-and-by,
when it was at its height, she heard Mr. Reste dash out at
the back door; she heard her father dash after him. In
the yard there seemed to be a scuffle, more hot words,
and then a sudden silence. Katrine rose and stole to the
window to look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not see either of them. But a noise in the
kitchen beneath, as if the fire-irons were thrown down,
seemed to say they had come back indoors. Another
minute and her father came out with a lighted lantern in his
hand; she wondered why, as it was moonlight. He crossed
the yard and went into the back kitchen, or brewhouse, as
it was more often called, and Katrine, hoping the quarrel
was over, got into bed again. Presently the back door was
shut with a bang that shook the room, and footsteps were
heard ascending the stairs, and afterwards all was quiet until
morning.</p>

<p>As on the past morning, so it was on this. When Katrine
got downstairs she found that neither her father nor Mr.
Reste was up. She breakfasted alone, and set off for the
Manor afterwards.</p>

<p>But, as it chanced, she was to have partial holiday that
day. Lena complained of a sore throat; she was subject to
sore throats; so Miss Barbary was released when the lesson
was half over, and returned home.</p>

<p>Going to her room to take her bonnet off, she found Joan
busy there. From the window she saw her father at work
at the far end of the garden. This was Thursday, the day
of the projected walk to Church Leet, and very lovely
weather. But Mr. Reste had not said anything about it
since the Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Reste gone out, Joan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Reste is gone, Miss Katrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo; asked she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone away; gone back to London,&rdquo; said Joan. Upon
which Katrine, staring at the old woman, inquired what she
meant.</p>

<p>It appeared that Mr. Barbary had left his chamber close
upon Katrine&rsquo;s departure, and sat down to breakfast. When
he had finished he called Joan to take the things away.
She inquired whether they had not better be left for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Mr. Reste. He answered that Mr. Reste was gone. &ldquo;What,
gone away back to London?&rdquo; Joan cried, in surprise; and
her master said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;You might just have knocked
me down with a feather, Miss Katrine, I was that took to,&rdquo;
added Joan now, in relating this. &ldquo;Never to say good-bye
to me, nor anything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine, thinking there was somebody else he had not
said good-bye to, could hardly speak from amazement.
&ldquo;When did he go, Joan? Since breakfast? Or was he
gone when I went out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; pondered Joan; &ldquo;it seems all a
moither in my head; as if I couldn&rsquo;t put this and that
together. I never saw nor heard anything of him at all this
morning, and I find his bed has not been slept in, which
looks as if he went last night. It&rsquo;s odd, too, that he didn&rsquo;t
say he was going, and it&rsquo;s odd he should start off to London
at midnight. Your papa is in one of his short tempers, Miss
Katrine, and I&rsquo;ve not dared to ask him about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine, as she listened, felt perfectly bewildered. Why
had he taken his departure in this strange manner? What
for? What had caused him to do it? Joan had told all
she knew, and it was of no use questioning her further.</p>

<p>Mr. Reste&rsquo;s chamber door stood open; Katrine halted at
it and looked in. Why! he seemed to have taken nothing
with him! His coats were hanging up; trifles belonging to
him lay about on chairs; on the side shelf stood his little
portable desk&mdash;and she had heard him say that he never
travelled without that desk, it went with him wherever he
went. Opening a drawer or two, she saw his linen, his
neckties, his handkerchiefs. What was the meaning of it
all? Could he have been recalled to London in some
desperate hurry? But no letter or summons of any kind
had come to Caramel Cottage, so far as she knew, except
the letter from Captain Amphlett on Tuesday morning, and
that one had not recalled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There be two pairs of his boots in the kitchen,&rdquo; said
Joan. &ldquo;He has took none with him but them he&rsquo;s got on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>must</em> ask papa about it,&rdquo; cried the puzzled Katrine.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary was at the bottom of the garden working
away at the celery bed in his shirt sleeves; his coat lay
across the cucumber-frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you home now?&rdquo; he cried out, looking up
as Katrine drew near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little girl is not well. Papa,&rdquo; she added, her voice
taking a timid, shrinking tone, she hardly knew why, &ldquo;Joan
says Mr. Reste is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why has he left so suddenly, without saying anything
about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could do so if he pleased. He was at liberty to go
or stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine could not dispute that. She hardly liked to say
more, her father&rsquo;s answers were so curt and cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have gone unexpectedly, papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unexpectedly! Not at all. He has been talking of
going all the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine paused. &ldquo;Is he coming back, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he has not taken any of his things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to pack his things and send them after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;<em>when</em> did he go, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary, who had kept on working, drew himself bolt
upright. Letting his hands rest on the handle of his spade,
he looked sternly into Katrine&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;&mdash;he never told me he was going. He never said
anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should he tell you?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Barbary.
&ldquo;It was enough that he told me. He thought he had been
quite long enough away from his work, and that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
high time to go back to it. I thought the same. That&rsquo;s all,
Katrine; you need not inquire further. And now you can
go indoors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She walked slowly up the narrow path, conscious that
some mystery must lie behind this. Joan was standing
in the yard, outside the back-kitchen door, trying to pull it
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This here back&rsquo;us door&rsquo;s locked!&rdquo; exclaimed Joan, in
her country vernacular. &ldquo;I want the spare jack out;
t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s given way at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be locked,&rdquo; dissented Katrine. &ldquo;It never is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never known the door locked afore; but &rsquo;tis
now, Miss Katrine. I noticed it was shut to all day yesterday,
but I didn&rsquo;t try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only stuck,&rdquo; said Katrine, laying hold of the high
old-fashioned bow handle which served to lift the latch
inside; and she shook it well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What are you about?&rdquo; called out
Mr. Barbary, dashing up the path like a flash of lightning.
&ldquo;Let the door alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joan says it is locked, papa,&rdquo; said Katrine, frightened by
his manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if it is? I have locked up some&mdash;some wine
there that came in. How dare you meddle with the places I
choose to keep closed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the other jack I want out, sir,&rdquo; said Joan, hearing
imperfectly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have the other jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, master, the old jack&rsquo;s broke clean in two, and it&rsquo;s
time to put the lamb down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it into chops,&rdquo; he cried, waving them both off, and
standing, himself, before the door, as if to guard it, with a
white, imperious, passionate face.</p>

<p>Single-minded old Joan went indoors, marvelling a little&mdash;such
a bit of a trouble for him to have opened the back&rsquo;us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
door and given her out the jack! Katrine followed, marvelling
very much. She did not believe in the wine: felt
sure no wine had come in; they never had any; what was
it that was locked up there? All in a moment a thought
flashed over her that it might be game: poached game:
pheasants and partridges and hares. But, upon that thought
came another: why should the spoil have been brought in
on Tuesday night when it had never (as she believed) been
brought before? Just a little came in for their own use,
nothing more.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>That day, Thursday, we had news of Don. And we had
it in this way. Tobias Jellico&mdash;who had a small draper&rsquo;s
shop at Evesham, and went about the country with a pack,
out of which he seduced unwary ladies to buy finery, more
particularly some of our ladies living in Piefinch Cut&mdash;was
at Church Dykely to-day on one of his periodical
visitations. We did not like the man or his trade; but
that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Hearing that the Squire&rsquo;s dog
was lost, he at once said he had seen Dick Standish that
morning in Bengeworth (a portion of Evesham) with a large
Newfoundland dog. White-and-brown, he called it; which
was a mistake, for Don was white and black; but Jellico
might not know colours. It was Mr. Duffham who brought
us this news in the afternoon: he had been sent for to Lena,
whose throat was getting worse. Duffham heard it from
Perkins the butcher, to whom Jellico told it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which item pleased the Squire most: that
Don was found, or that the guilt of Tuesday night was
traced home to the Standishes; for the three brothers had
in general a certain gentleman&rsquo;s own luck, and were rarely
caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don went out roaming, through that villain Giles unloosing
him and leaving the yard gate open,&rdquo; decided the
Squire, in his excitement. &ldquo;The dog must have sprung
upon them; he has a mortal enmity to tramps and poachers,
you know, Duffham; and the Standishes captured him. I&rsquo;ll
send a message to the police at Evesham at once, to look
after Mr. Dick, and go over myself in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad the dog&rsquo;s found,&rdquo; said Duffham.
&ldquo;But what an idiot Dick Standish must be to allow himself
to be seen with the dog in the public streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the Squire, turning to me as he was
leaving the room to send a man galloping on horseback to
the Evesham police, &ldquo;you run over to Caramel Cottage.
Make my compliments to young Reste; say that I am going
to drive to Evesham to-morrow morning, and shall be happy
to take him if he likes to accompany me. I offered to drive
him over some day before he left, but this bother has caused
me to delay it. Shall start at nine o&rsquo;clock, tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the time the Squire was charging me with this
message, Katrine Barbary was sitting in the homely garden
at Caramel Cottage, amidst the fruit trees, the vegetables,
and the late flowers. The October sunlight fell on her
pretty face, that somehow put you in mind of a peach with
its softest bloom upon it.</p>

<p>Katrine was striving to see daylight out of a mass of perplexity,
of which I then knew nothing, and she could not
discern a single ray. Why should that fine young barrister,
Edgar Reste, staying with them so peacefully for several
weeks past, and fully intending to stay this week out&mdash;why
should he have run away by night, leaving behind him an
atmosphere of mystery? This question would never leave
Katrine&rsquo;s mind by night or by day.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the afternoon sun, she was running over
mentally, for the tenth time or so, the details of the affair.
One or two of them might have looked somewhat shady to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a suspicious observer; to Katrine they presented only a web
of perplexity. She felt sure that when she went to bed on
the Wednesday night he had no thought of leaving; and
yet it seemed that he did leave. When Joan rose in the
early morning, he had disappeared&mdash;vanished, as may be
said. The puzzle that Katrine could not solve was this:
why had he gone away in haste so great that he could not
take his clothes with him? and why had he gone at all in
an unexpected, stealthy way, saying nothing to anybody?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks just as though he had run away to escape
some imminent danger, with not a minute to spare,&rdquo; mused
Katrine.</p>

<p>At this moment Katrine met with an interruption to her
thoughts in the shape of me. Catching a glimpse of her
print frock through the hedge, I went straight in at the little
side gate, without troubling the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Johnny,&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand, and
making room for me on the bench. And as I took the
seat, I said what I had come for&mdash;to deliver the Squire&rsquo;s
message to Mr. Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Reste has left us,&rdquo; said Katrine. &ldquo;He went away
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Went away last night!&rdquo; I exclaimed, the news
surprising me uncommonly. &ldquo;What took him off so
suddenly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Open-natured as the day, Katrine told me the particulars
(which proved that she had no dark fears about it as yet), of
course saying nothing about the poaching. And she did
mention the quarrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so strange that he should leave all his things behind
him&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see that, Johnny?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even that
little desk, full of private papers, is left, and he never travels
without it; his boots are left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have had some news to call him away.
A letter perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The only letter he has had lately came on Tuesday
morning,&rdquo; returned Katrine. &ldquo;It had a good deal of money
in it in bank-notes; sixty pounds; but it did not call him
away. <em>Nothing</em> called him away, that I can discover. You
can&rsquo;t think how it is worrying me; it seems just a mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Katrine,&rdquo; I said, after mentally twisting the
matter this way and that, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known the most unaccountable
problems turn out to be the simplest on explanation.
When you hear from him, as you most likely will in a day
or two, I dare say he will tell you he was called away
unexpectedly, and had to go at once. Does not Mr.
Barbary know why he went?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; I fancy he does: he is indoors now, packing
Mr. Reste&rsquo;s things: but he does not tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After talking a little longer, we strolled up the path
together, and had reached the yard when Mr. Barbary
suddenly opened the kitchen door to shake the dust from a
coat that seemed covered with it. His handsome face took
a haughty expression, and his slender, shapely form was
drawn up in pride as he looked sternly at me, as much as to
say, &ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned, on my way to the side gate, to explain: that Don
had been seen at Evesham in the company of Dick Standish,
that the Squire would be driving thither on the morrow, and
had thought Mr. Reste might like to go with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very kind of Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo; drawled Barbary in his
stand-off manner. &ldquo;Tell him, with my compliments and
thanks for his courtesy, that my nephew has left for
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left for good, I suppose?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the present, at any rate. A pressing matter of
business recalled him, and he had to attend to it without
delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at Katrine: there was the explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the dog is at Evesham!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Barbary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Standishes are great rogues, all three of them, and
Dick&rsquo;s the worst. But&mdash;I think&mdash;had you gone after him
to-day, instead of delaying it until to-morrow, there might
have been more certainty of finding him. Mr. Dick may
give you leg-bail in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police will see he does not do that; the Squire
has sent a messenger to warn them,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I suppose
you have not heard any more rumours about the poaching
on Tuesday night, Mr. Barbary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard no more than was said at first&mdash;that the
keepers reported some poachers were out, and they nearly
came to an encounter with the rascals. Wish they had&mdash;and
that I had seen the fun. Reste and I had walked to
Church Leet and back that day; we were both tired and
went upstairs betimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To hear him coolly assert this, to see his good-looking
face raised unblushingly to the sun as he said it, must have
been as a bitter farce to Katrine, who had believed him,
until a few days back, to be next door to a saint for truth
and goodness. <em>I</em> put faith in it, not being then behind the
scenes.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary did his packing leisurely. Tea was over,
and dusk set in before the portmanteau was shut up and its
direction fastened to it. Katrine read the card. &ldquo;Edgar
Reste, Esq., Euston Square Station, London. <em>To be left till
called for.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very lonely felt Katrine, sitting by herself that evening,
working a strip of muslin for a frill. <em>He</em> was not there
to talk to her in his voice of music&mdash;for that&rsquo;s what
she had grown to think it, like other girls in love. She
wondered whether they should ever meet again&mdash;ever, ever?
She wondered how long it would be before a letter came
from him, and whether he would write to <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary appeared at supper-time, ate some cold lamb
in silence, seeming to be buried in thought, and went back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to the gun-room when he had finished. Katrine got to her
work again, did a little, then put it away for the night, and
turned to the book-shelf to get a book.</p>

<p>Standing to make a choice of one, Katrine was seized
with consternation. On the lower shelf, staring her right in
the face, was Mr. Reste&rsquo;s Bible. It had been given him by
his dead father, and he set store by it. He must have left
it downstairs the previous Sunday, and Joan had put it
away on the shelves amongst the other books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if papa would mind opening the portmanteau
again?&rdquo; thought Katrine, as she hastened to the gun-room,
and entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa! papa! here&rsquo;s Mr. Reste&rsquo;s Bible left out,&rdquo; she
cried, impulsively. &ldquo;Can you put it into the portmanteau?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary stood by the small safe in the wall, the door
of which was open. In his hand lay some bank-notes; he
was holding them towards the candle on the deal table, and
seemed to be counting them. Katrine, thinking of the
Bible and of nothing else, went close to him, and her eye
fell on the notes. He flung them into the cupboard in a
covert manner, gave the door a slam, turned an angry face
on Katrine, and a sharp tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you come bursting in upon me in this
boisterous fashion? I won&rsquo;t have it. What? Will I undo
the portmanteau to put in a Bible? No, I won&rsquo;t. Keep it
till he chooses to come for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrank away frightened, softly closing the door
behind her. Those bank-notes belonged to Mr. Reste:
they were the same she had seen him put into his pocket-book
two days ago. Why had he not taken them with
him?&mdash;what brought them in her father&rsquo;s possession? The
advance shadow of the dark trouble, soon to come, crept
into Katrine Barbary&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>In no mood for reading now, she went to bed, and lay
trying to think it out. What did it all mean? Had her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
father conjured the pocket-book by sleight-of-hand out of
Mr. Reste&rsquo;s keeping and <em>stolen</em> the notes? She strove to
put the disgraceful thought away from her, and could not.
The distress brought to her by the poaching seemed as
nothing to this, bad though that was.&mdash;And would he venture
abroad to-night again?</p>

<p>Joan&rsquo;s light foot-fall passed her door, going up to her
bed in the roof. Once there, nothing ever disturbed the old
servant or her deafness until getting-up time in the morning.
Katrine lay on, no sleep in her eyes; half the night
it would have seemed, but that she had learned how slowly
time passes with the restless. Still, it was a good while
past twelve, she thought, when curious sounds, as of <em>digging</em>,
seemed to arise from the garden. Sounds too faint perhaps
to have been heard in the day-time, but which penetrated
to her ear unless she was mistaken, in the deep, uncanny,
undisturbed silence of the night. She sat up in bed to
listen.</p>

<p>There, it came again! What could it be? People did
not dig up gardens at midnight. Slipping out of bed, she
drew the blind aside and peeped out.</p>

<p>The night was light as day, with a bright, clear, beautiful
moon: the hunters&rsquo; moon. Underneath the summer-apple
tree, close at this end of the garden, bent Mr. Barbary,
digging away with all his might, his large iron spade turning
up the earth swiftly and silently. Katrine&rsquo;s eyes grew wide
with amazement. He had dug up that same plot of ground
only a few days ago, in readiness to plant winter greens:
she and Edgar Reste had stood looking on for a time, talking
with him as to the sort of greens he meant to put in.
Why was he digging up the same ground again?&mdash;and why
was he doing it at this unearthly hour?</p>

<p>It appeared to be a hole that was being dug now, for he
threw the spadefuls of mould up on each side pretty far.
The ground seemed quite soft and pliant; owing perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to its having been so recently turned. As the hole grew
larger; wider and longer and deeper; an idea flashed over
Katrine that it looked just as though it were meant for a
grave. Not that she thought it.</p>

<p>Putting a warm shawl on her shoulders and slippers on
her feet, she sat down before the window, drew the blind
up an inch or two, and kept looking out, her curiosity greatly
excited. The moon shone steadily, the time passed, and
the hole grew yet larger. Suddenly Mr. Barbary paused
in his work, and held up his head as if to listen. Did he
fear, or fancy, a noise in the field pathway outside, or in
the dark grove to the right near Caramel&rsquo;s Farm? Apparently
so: and that he must not be seen at his work. For
he got out of the hole, left the spade in it, came with noiseless,
swift, stealthy movement up the yard, and concealed
himself in the dark tool-shed. Presently, he stole across to
the little gate, looked well about him to the right and left,
and then resumed his digging.</p>

<p>Quite six feet long it soon looked to Katrine, and three
or more feet wide, and how deep she knew not. <em>Was it for
a grave?</em> The apprehension really stole across her, and
with a sick faintness. If so, if so&mdash;? A welcome ray of
possibility dawned then. Had her father (warned by this
stir that was going on, the search for poachers and their
spoil) a lot of contraband game in his possession that
must be hidden away out of sight? Perhaps so.</p>

<p>It seemed to be finished now. The moon had sailed
ever so far across the sky by this time, but was still shining
full upon it. Mr. Barbary crept again to the gate and stood
listening and looking up and down in the silence of the
night. Then he crossed to the brewhouse, took the key
from his pocket, unlocked it, and went inside. Katrine
could see the flash of the match as he struck a light.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the brewhouse he was dragging a
weight along the ground with two strong cords. A huge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
unshapely, heavy substance enveloped in what looked like
matting or sacking. Dragging it straight over the yard to
the grave, Mr. Barbary let it fall carefully in, cords and
all, and began to shovel in the mould upon it with desperate
haste.</p>

<p>Terror seized on Katrine. What was in that matting?
All in an instant, a little corner of the veil&mdash;that had
obscured from her understanding so much which had seemed
mysterious and unfathomable&mdash;lifted itself, bringing to her
an awful conviction. Was it Edgar Reste that was being
put out of the way; buried for ever from the sight of man?
Her father must have killed him; must have done it in
a passion! Katrine Barbary cried out with a loud and
bitter cry.</p>

<p>Fascinated by the sight of terror, she was unable to draw
her eyes away. But the next moment they had caught
sight of another object, bringing equal terror, though of a
different nature: some one, who had apparently crept in at
the gate unheard, was standing at the corner of the garden
hedge, looking on. Was it an officer of the law, come to
spy upon her father and denounce his crime? But, even as
she gazed, the figure drew back to make its exit by the gate
again, and to Katrine it seemed to take my form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Johnny Ludlow!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, I pray that
it may be! I think <em>he</em> would not betray him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine watched on. She saw the grave filled in; she
saw her father stamp it down; she saw him carry the
superfluous mould to a place under the wall, near the manure
bed, and she saw him stamp that down, and then cover it
loosely with some of the manure, so that it might look like a
part of the heap. Then he seemed to be coming in, and
Katrine thought it must be nearing the dawn.</p>

<p>Creeping into bed, she hid her face, that never again
ought to show itself amidst honest men, under the clothes.
Some covert stir yet seemed to be going on in the yard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as of pumping and scrubbing. Turning from hot to cold,
from cold to hot, Katrine was seized with a shivering fit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who really was it watching?&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;It
looked like Johnny, yet I can&rsquo;t be sure; he stood in the
shade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was <em>me</em>, as the schoolboys say. And the reason of
my being there at the small, unearthly hours of the morning,
together with the conclusion of this appalling story, will be
found in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>CARAMEL COTTAGE</h2>


<h3>III.&mdash;DON THE SECOND</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>We have a saying in England, &ldquo;It never rains but it pours,&rdquo;
as applied, not to the rain, but to the occurrences of daily
life. Dyke Manor was generally quiet enough, but on
Thursday evening&mdash;the Thursday already told of&mdash;we were
destined to have visitors. First of all, arrived Mr. Jacobson,
our neighbour at Elm Farm, with his nephew, young Harry
Dene; he had his gig put up, meaning to make an evening
of it. It turned out to be a night, or nearly so, as you will
soon find. Close upon that, Charles Stirling of the Court
(my place) came in; and Mrs. Todhetley went to the
kitchen to say that we should require supper. The stirring
events of the week had brought them over&mdash;namely, the
encounter on our land between the poachers and the
keepers, and the flight of the valuable yard dog, Don, a
Newfoundland.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Thursday, we had heard, as may be
remembered, that Don was at Evesham, under the keeping
of Mr. Dick Standish; and I had been told by Katrine
Barbary that Mr. Reste had suddenly and unexpectedly disappeared
from Caramel Cottage. Old Jacobson predicted
that Dick Standish would come to be hanged; Charles
Stirling said he ought to be transported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will prosecute him, Squire?&rdquo; said Charles
Stirling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall,&rdquo; replied the Squire, warmly. &ldquo;The
police have him already safe enough if they&rsquo;ve done their
duty, and I shall be over at Evesham in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a jolly supper they got to their pipes, and the time
went by on wings. At least, that&rsquo;s what the master of Elm
Farm said when the clocks struck eleven, and he asked
leave to order his gig.</p>

<p>It was brought round by Giles, the groom; and we were
all assembled in the hall to speed the departure, when old
Jones, the constable, burst in upon us at the full speed of
his gouty legs, his face in a white heat.</p>

<p>Private information had reached Jones half an hour ago
that the poachers intended to be out again that night, but
he could not learn in which direction.</p>

<p>Then commotion arose. The Squire and his friend
Jacobson were like two demented wild Indians, uncertain
what was best to be done to entrap the villains. The gig
was ordered away again.</p>

<p>Some time passed in discussion. In these moments of
excitement one cannot always bring one&rsquo;s keenest wits to
the fore. Charles Stirling offered to go out and reconnoitre;
we, you may be quite sure, were eager to second him. I
went with Charles Stirling one way; Tod and Harry Dene
went another&mdash;leaving the Squire and Mr. Jacobson at the
gate, listening for shots, and conferring in whispers with old
Jones.</p>

<p>How long we marched about under the bright moonlight,
keeping under the shade of the trees and hedges, I cannot
tell you; but when we all four met at Dyke Neck, which
lay between the Manor and the Court, we had seen nothing.
Mr. Stirling went straight home then, but we continued our
ramblings. A schoolboy&rsquo;s ardour is not quickly damped.</p>

<p>Beating about fresh ground together for a little while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
we then separated. I went across towards the village: the
other two elsewhere. It was one of the loveliest of nights,
the full moon bright as day, the air warm and soft. But
I neither saw nor heard signs of any poachers, and I began
to suspect that somebody had played a trick on the old
constable.</p>

<p>I turned short back at the thought, and made, as the
Americans say, tracks for home. My nearest way was
through the dense grove of trees at the back of Caramel
Farm, and I took it, though it was not the liveliest way by
any means.</p>

<p>But no sooner was I beyond the grove than sounds struck
on my ear in the stillness of the night. They seemed to come
from the direction of Caramel Cottage. Darting under the
side hedge, and then across the side lane, and so under the
hedge again that bound the cottage, I stole on the grass as
softly as a mouse. Poachers could not be at work there;
but an idea flashed across me that somebody had got into
Mr. Barbary&rsquo;s well-stocked garden, and was robbing it.</p>

<p>Peering through the hedge, I saw Barbary himself. He
was coming out of the brewhouse, dragging behind him,
with two cords, a huge sack of some kind, well-filled and
heavy. Opposite the open door, on the furnace, shone
a lighted horn lantern. Mr. Barbary pushed-to the door
behind him, thereby shutting out the light, dragged his
burden over the yard to the garden, and let it fall into what
looked like&mdash;a freshly dug grave.</p>

<p>Astonishment kept me intensely still. What did it all
mean? Hardly daring to breathe, I stole in at the gate
and under the shade of the hedge. Whatever it might
contain, that sacking lay perfectly quiet, and Mr. Barbary
began to shovel in the spadefuls of earth upon it, as one
does upon a coffin.</p>

<p>This was nothing for me to interfere with, and I went
away silently. It looked like a mystery, and a dark one;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
any way it was being done in secret in the witching hours
of the night. What the time might be I knew not, the
Squire having ordered our watches taken off before starting:
perhaps one, or two, or three o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>Tod and Harry Dene reached the gate of Dyke Manor
just as I did; and we were greeted, all three, with a storm
of reproaches by the Squire and Mr. Jacobson. What did
we mean by it?&mdash;scampering off like that for hours?&mdash;for
<em>hours</em>!&mdash;Three times had the gig been brought out and put
up again! Harry was bundled headforemost into the gig,
and Mr. Jacobson drove off.</p>

<p>And it turned out that my suspicion touching old Jones
was right. Some young men had played the trick upon
him. I need not have mentioned it at all, but for seeing
what I did see in Barbary&rsquo;s garden.</p>

<p>How Katrine Barbary passed that night you have seen:
for, like many another story-teller, I have had to carry you
back a few hours. Shivering and shaking, now hot, now
cold, she lay, striving to reason with herself that <em>it could not
be</em>; that so dreadful a thing was not possible; that she was
the most wicked girl on earth for imagining it: and she
strove in vain. All the events of the past day or two kept
crowding into her mind one upon another in flaring colours,
like the figures in some hideous phantasmagoria. The
unexpected arrival of the bank-notes for Mr. Reste; her
father&rsquo;s covetous look at them and his dreadful joke; their
going out together that night poaching; their quarrelling
together the next morning; their worse quarrelling at night,
and their dashing out to the yard (as if in passion) one after
the other. And, so far as Katrine could trace it, that was
the very last seen or heard of Edgar Reste. The next
morning he was gone; gone in a mysterious manner,
leaving all his possessions behind him. Her father was
reticent over it; would not explain. Then came the little
episode of the locked-up brewhouse, which had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
locked before in Joan&rsquo;s memory. Mr. Barbary refused to
unlock it, said he had put some wine there; told Joan she
must do without the jack. What had really been hidden in
that brewhouse? Katrine felt faint at the thought. <em>Not
wine.</em> And the terrible farce of packing Mr. Reste&rsquo;s effects
and addressing them to Euston Square Station, London!
Would they lie there for ever&mdash;unclaimed? Alas, alas!
The proofs were only too palpable. Edgar Reste had been
put out of the world for ever. She had been the shivering
witness to his secret burial.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Katrine? Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inquiry was made by Mr. Barbary next day at
breakfast. Sick unto death she looked. The very bright
night had given place to a showery morning, and the rain
pattered against the window-panes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a headache,&rdquo; answered Katrine, faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better send Joan to the Manor to say you cannot attend
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would rather go; I must go,&rdquo; she said hastily.
For this good girl had been schooling herself as well as she
knew how; making up her mind to persevere in fulfilling
the daily duties of her life in the best way she should be
able; lest, if she fell short abruptly, suspicion might turn
towards her father. She had wildly prayed Heaven to grant
her strength and help to bear up on her course. Not from
her must come the pointing finger of discovery. It is true
that he&mdash;Edgar&mdash;was her first and dearest love; she should
never love another as she had loved him; but she was her
father&rsquo;s child, and held him sacred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why must you go?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Barbary, as, having
finished a plate of broiled mushrooms, he began upon a
couple of eggs with an appetite that the night&rsquo;s work did not
seem to have spoiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The air&mdash;the walk&mdash;may do me good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know best, child. I suppose Todhetley
be off to Evesham after that dog of theirs,&rdquo; Mr. Barbary
went on to remark. &ldquo;Master Dick Standish must be a bold
sinner to steal the dog one day and parade the open streets
with it the next! If&mdash;&mdash; What is it now, Joan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For old Joan had come in with a face of surprise.
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;has Tom Noah been at work here this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; replied Mr. Barbary. Tom Noah,
an industrious young fellow, son to Noah, the gardener, was
occasionally employed by Mr. Barbary to clean up the yard
and clear the garden of its superfluous rubbish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our back&rsquo;us has been scrubbed out this morning, sir,&rdquo;
went on Joan, still in astonishment. &ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t want
it. Who in the world can have come in and gone and
done it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it has, master; scrubbed clean; the flags are all wet
still. And the rain-water barrel&rsquo;s a&rsquo;most empty, nearly every
drop of water drawn out of it! I&rsquo;d not say but the yard has
had a bit of a scrubbing, too, near the garden, as well as the
back&rsquo;us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Barbary, his light tone
becoming irritable. &ldquo;You see it has been raining! the rain
has drifted into the brewhouse, that&rsquo;s all; I left the door open
last night. There! go back to your work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan was a simple-natured woman, but she was neither silly
nor blind, and she knew that what she said was true. Rapidly
turning the matter over in her mind, she came to the conclusion
that Tom Noah had been in &ldquo;unbeknown to the
master,&rdquo; and so left the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I may take out the spare jack now, sir?&rdquo; she
waited to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take out anything you like,&rdquo; replied Mr. Barbary.</p>

<p>Afraid of her tell-tale face, Katrine had moved to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
window, apparently to look at the weather. Too well she
knew who had scrubbed out the place, and why.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased when she set off on her short walk&mdash;for
it was not much more than a stone&rsquo;s throw to the Manor;
the sun was struggling from behind the clouds, blue sky could
be seen. Alone with herself and the open country, Katrine
gave vent to her pent-up spirit, which she had not dared to
do indoors; sighs of anguish and of pain escaped her; she
wondered whether it would be wrong if she prayed to die.
But some one was advancing to meet her, and she composed
her countenance.</p>

<p>It was Ben Gibbon. For the past week or so, since
Katrine had been enlightened as to her father&rsquo;s poaching
propensities, she had somehow feared this man. He was son
to the late James Gibbon, the former gamekeeper at Chavasse
Grange, and brother to the present keeper, Richard. Of
course one might expect that Mr. Benjamin would protect
game and gamekeepers; instead of which, he was known to
do a little safe poaching on his own account, and to be an
idle fellow altogether. Katrine did not like his intimacy
with her father, and she could not forget that he had passed
part of that fatal evening with him and Edgar Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Showery weather to-day, miss,&rdquo; was Ben Gibbon&rsquo;s
salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; answered Katrine, with intense civility&mdash;for
how could she tell what the man might know?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall find Mr. Barbary at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; faintly spoke she, and passed on her way.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>We started for Evesham under a sharp shower, the Squire
driving Bob and Blister in the large phaeton. Tod sat with
him, I and the groom behind. Not a shadow of doubt lay
on any one of us that we should bring back Don in triumph&mdash;leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Dick Standish to be dealt with according to his
merits. But, as the Squire remarked later, we were not a
match for Dick in cunning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes open, lads,&rdquo; the Squire said to us as we
approached the town. &ldquo;And if you see Dick Standish, with
or without the dog, jump out and pounce upon him. You
hear, Giles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to tell me to do it, sir,&rdquo; answered Giles humbly,
clenching his fists; he had been eating humble pie ever since
Tuesday night. &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dick Standish was not seen. Leaving the carriage
and Giles at the inn, we made our way to the police station.
An officer named Brett attended to us. It was curious
enough, but the first person we saw inside the station was
Tobias Jellico, who had called in on some matter of business
that concerned his shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had your message yesterday, sir,&rdquo; said Brett to the
Squire, &ldquo;and we lost no time in seeing after Standish. But
it is not your dog that he has with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not my dog!&rdquo; repeated the Squire, up in arms at once.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that, Brett. Whose dog should it be but
mine? Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I never saw your dog; but Tomkins, one of our
men, who has often been on duty at Church Dykely, knows
it well,&rdquo; rejoined Brett. &ldquo;We had Standish and the dog up
here, and Tomkins at once said it was not your dog at all,
so we let the man go. Mr. Jellico also says it is not yours;
I was talking to him about it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I said was this,&rdquo; put in Jellico, stepping forward,
and speaking with meek deprecation. &ldquo;If Squire Todhetley&rsquo;s
dog has been described to me correctly, the dog I saw
with Standish yesterday can&rsquo;t be the same. It is a great big
ugly dog, with tan marks about his white coat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugly!&rdquo; retorted the Squire, resenting the aspersion, for
he fully believed it to be Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not at all an ugly dog, it&rsquo;s a handsome dog,&rdquo; spoke
up Brett. &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Jellico does not like dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; confessed Jellico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you to say yesterday at Church Dykely that
it was the same dog?&rdquo; Tod asked the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, I didn&rsquo;t exactly say it was; I said I
made no doubt of it,&rdquo; returned Jellico, mild as new milk.
&ldquo;It was in this way: Perkins the butcher was standing at his
shop door as I passed down the street. We began talking,
and he told me about the poachers having been out on the
Tuesday night, and that Squire Todhetley had lost his fine
Newfoundland dog; he said it was thought the Standishes
were in both games. So then I said I had met Dick Standish
with just such a dog that morning as I was a-coming out of
Evesham. I had never seen the Squire&rsquo;s dog, you perceive,
gentlemen; but neither Mr. Perkins nor me had any doubt
it was his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it must be mine,&rdquo; returned the Squire, hotly. &ldquo;Send
for the dog, Brett; I will see it. Send for Standish also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send, sir,&rdquo; replied Brett, rather dubiously, &ldquo;and get
the man here if he is to be had. The chances are that with
all this bother Standish has left the town and taken the dog
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brett was a talkative man, with a mottled face and sandy
hair. He despatched a messenger to see after Standish.
Jellico went out at the same time, telling Brett that his business
could wait till another day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is my dog,&rdquo; affirmed the Squire to Brett while
he waited. Nothing on earth, except actual sight, would
have convinced him that it was not his. &ldquo;Those loose men
play all sorts of cunning tricks. Dick Standish is full of
them. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but he has <em>painted</em> the dog; done
his black marks over with brown paint&mdash;or <em>green</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a dyer in this town, Squire,&rdquo; related Brett; &ldquo;he
owns a little white curly dog, and he dyes him as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
advertisement for his colours, and lets him run about on the
pavement before the shop door. To-day the dog will be a
delicate sky-blue, to-morrow a flaming scarlet; the next day
he&rsquo;ll be a beautiful orange, with a green tail. The neighbours&rsquo;
dogs collect round and stand looking at him from a
respectful distance, uncertain, I suppose, whether he is of the
dog species, or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Passing the shop the other day, I saw the dog sitting on
the door-step,&rdquo; ran on Brett. &ldquo;He was bright purple that
time. An old lady, driving by in her chariot, caught sight
of the dog and called to the coachman to pull up. There
she sat, that old lady, entranced with amazement, staring
through her eye-glass at what she took to be a phenomenon
in nature. Five minutes, full, she stared, and couldn&rsquo;t tear
herself away. It is true, gentlemen, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Dick Standish was found, and brought before us. He
looked rather more disreputable than usual, his old fustian
coat out at elbows, a spotted red handkerchief twisted loosely
round his neck. The dog was with him, <em>and it was not ours</em>.
A large, fine dog, as already described, though much less
handsome than Don, and out of condition, his curly coat a
yellowish white, the marks on it of real tan colour, not
painted.</p>

<p>Dick&rsquo;s account, after vehemently protesting he had nothing
to do with the poaching affair on Tuesday night, was never
for a minute out of his bed&mdash;was this: The dog belonged to
one of the stable-helpers at Leet Hall; but the man had
determined to have the dog shot, not being satisfied with
him of late, for the animal had turned odd and uncertain in
his behaviour. Dick Standish heard of this. Understanding
dogs thoroughly, and believing that this dog only wanted a
certain course of treatment to put him right, Standish walked
to Church Leet on Wednesday morning last from Church
Dykely, and asked the man, Brazer, to give him the dog&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
would take him and run all risks. Brazer refused at first;
but, after a bit, agreed to let Standish keep the dog for a
time. If he cured the dog, Brazer was to have him back
again, paying Standish for his keep and care; but if not
satisfied with the dog, Standish might keep him for good.
Standish brought the dog away, and took him straight to
Evesham, walking the whole way and getting there about
nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening. He was doctoring the dog well,
and hoped to cure him.</p>

<p>Whether this tale was true or whether it wasn&rsquo;t, none of us
could contradict it. But there was an appearance of fear,
of shuffling in the man&rsquo;s manner, which seemed to indicate
that something lay behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s every word gospel, ain&rsquo;t it, Rove, and no lie
nowhere,&rdquo; cried Standish, bending to pat the dog, while the
corner of his eye was turned to regard the aspect of the
company. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve blown me up for many things before
now, Squire Todhetley, but there&rsquo;s no call, sir, to accuse me
this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you hear about this dog of Brazer&rsquo;s, and who
told you of it?&rdquo; inquired Tod, in his haughty way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Bill Rimmer, sir; he telled me on Tuesday night,&rdquo;
replied Dick. &ldquo;And I said to him what a shame it was to
talk of destroying that there fine dog, and that Brazer was a
soft for thinking on&rsquo;t. And I said, young Mr. Todhetley,
that I&rsquo;d be over at Church Leet first thing the next morning,
to see if he&rsquo;d give the dog to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not my dog, I see that,&rdquo; spoke the Squire, breaking
the silence that followed Dick&rsquo;s speech; &ldquo;and it may be the
stableman&rsquo;s at Leet Hall; that&rsquo;s a thing readily ascertained.
Do you know where my dog is, Dick Standish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; replied the man in a very eager
tone; &ldquo;and I never knowed at all, till fetched to this police
station yesterday, that your dog was a-missing. I&rsquo;ll swear I
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done, but to accept the
failure, and leave the station, after privately charging the
police to keep an eye on clever Mr. Dick Standish, his
haunts, and his movements.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we drove back home, not best pleased
with the day&rsquo;s work. A sense of having been <em>done</em>, in some
way or other not at present explicable, lay on most of us.</p>

<p>It appeared that the groom shared this feeling strongly.
In passing through the yard, I came upon him in his shirt
sleeves, seated outside the stable door on an inverted
bucket. His elbows on his knees and his face in his hands,
he looked the image of despair. The picture arrested me.
Mack was rubbing down the horses; a duty Giles rarely
entrusted to anybody. He was fond of Don, and had been
ready to hang himself ever since Tuesday night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Giles! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter enough, Master Johnny, when a false villyan like
that Dick Standish can take the master, and the police their-selves,
and everybody else, in!&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;I felt
as cock-sure, sir, that we should bring home Don as I am
that the sky above us is shining out blue after the last
shower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was not Don, you see, Giles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> wasn&rsquo;t; the dog Standish had to show,&rdquo; returned
Giles, with a peculiar emphasis. &ldquo;Dick had got up his tale
all smooth and sleek, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know he had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he told it me over again&mdash;the one he said he
had been telling at the police station, Master Johnny. I
was standing outside the inn yard while you were all in at
lunch, and Standish came by as bold as brass, Brazer&rsquo;s dog,
Rover, leashed to his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is Brazer&rsquo;s dog?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Brazer&rsquo;s dog, that&rsquo;un be,&rdquo; said Giles, with a
deep amount of scorn; &ldquo;I know <em>him</em> well enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how can it be Don? And we could not bring
home another man&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giles paused. His eyes had a far-off look in them, as if
seeking for something they could not find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Johnny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rightly grasp things.
All the way home I&rsquo;ve been trying to put two and two
together, I am trying at it still, and I can&rsquo;t do it anyhow.
Don&rsquo;t it seem odd to you, sir, that Standish should have got
Brazer&rsquo;s dog, Rover, into his hands just at the very time we
are suspecting he has got Don into &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not know. I had not thought about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has that dog of Brazer&rsquo;s as a blind. A blind, and
nothing else, sir. He has captured our dog, safe and sure,
and is keeping him hid up somewhere till the first storm of
the search is over, when he&rsquo;ll be able to dispose of him
safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not see Giles&rsquo;s drift, or how the one dog could
help to conceal the possession of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I can&rsquo;t explain it better,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t fit the pieces of the puzzle into one another in my
mind <em>yet</em>. But I am positive it is so. Dick Standish has
made up the farce about Brazer&rsquo;s dog and got him into his
hands to throw dust in our eyes and keep us off the scent
of Don.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to see the groom might be right; and that the
Standishes, sly and crafty, were keeping Don in hiding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley had met us with a face of concern.
Lena&rsquo;s throat was becoming very bad indeed, and Mr.
Duffham did not like the look of it at all. He had already
come twice that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Johnny,&rdquo; said the mother to me, &ldquo;that we had
better stop Miss Barbary&rsquo;s coming to-morrow; Mr. Duffham
does not know but the malady may be getting infectious.
Suppose you go now to the cottage and tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I went off to do so, and found her ill. On this same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Friday afternoon, having occasion to ask some question of
her father, who was in the garden, she found him planting
greens on the plot of ground&mdash;the <em>grave</em>&mdash;under the summer-apple
tree. Before she could speak, a shudder of terror
seized her; she trembled from head to foot, turned back to
the kitchen, and sat down on the nearest chair.</p>

<p>Old Joan pronounced it to be an attack of ague; Miss
Katrine, she said, must have taken a chill. Perhaps she
had. It was just then that I arrived and found her shivering
in the kitchen. Joan ran up to her room in the garret
to bring down some powder she kept there, said to be a
grand remedy for ague.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk then; the sun had set. To me,
Katrine seemed to be shaking with terror, not illness. Mr.
Barbary, in full view of the window, was planting the winter
greens under the summer-apple tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that you are frightened at?&rdquo; I said, propping
my back against the kitchen mantelpiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>must</em> ask you a question, Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; she
whispered, panting and shivering. &ldquo;Was it you who came
and stood inside the gate there in the middle of last
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it was. And I saw what Mr. Barbary was doing&mdash;<em>there</em>.
I could not make it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine left her chair and placed herself before me.
Clasping her piteous hands, she besought me to be silent;
to keep the secret for pity sake&mdash;to be <em>true</em>. All kinds of
odd ideas stole across me. I would not listen to them;
only promised her that I would tell nothing, would be true
for ever and a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been an accident, you know,&rdquo; she pleaded;
&ldquo;it must have been an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joan came back, and I took my departure. What on
earth could Katrine have meant? All kinds of fancies
were troubling my brain, fit only for what in these later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
days are called the penny dreadfuls, and I did my best to
drive them out of it.</p>

<p>The next morning Katrine was really ill. Her throat
was parched, her body ached with fever. As to Lena, she
was worse; and we, who ought to have gone back to school
that day, were kept at home lest we should carry with us
any infection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows
nobody good.&rdquo; He did not believe in the infection; told
me in private that Duffham was an old woman.</p>

<p>Can any one picture, I wonder, Katrine Barbary&rsquo;s distress
of mind, the terrible dread that had taken possession of it?
Shuddering dread, amounting to a panic: dread of the deed
itself, dread for her father, dread of discovery.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Sunday, a letter was delivered
at Caramel Cottage for Mr. Reste, the postmark being
London, the writing in the same hand as the last&mdash;Captain
Amphlett&rsquo;s. Mr. Barbary took it away to his gun-room;
Katrine saw it, later in the day, lying on the deal-table there,
unopened.</p>

<p>The next Thursday afternoon, Lena being then almost
well&mdash;for children are dying to-day and running about
again to-morrow&mdash;I called at the Cottage to ask after
Katrine. We heard she had an attack of fever. The
weather was lovely again; the October sky blue as in
summer, the sun hot and bright.</p>

<p>Well, she did look ill! She sat in the parlour at the open
window, a huge shawl on, and her poor face about half the
size it was before. What had it been, I asked, and she said
ague; but she was much better now and intended to be at
the Manor again on Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down please, Johnny. I suppose Lena has been glad
of the holiday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just has. That young lady believes French was
invented for her especial torment. Have you heard from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Mr. Reste, Katrine?&mdash;&mdash;What does he say about his impromptu
flitting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned white as a ghost, never answering, looking
at me strangely. I thought a spasm might have seized
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; she faintly said. &ldquo;Papa thinks&mdash;thinks he
may have gone abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I was digesting the words, some vehicle was heard
rattling up the side lane; it turned the corner and stopped
at the gate. &ldquo;Why, Katrine,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is a railway fly
from Evesham!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little fair man in a grey travelling-suit got out of the
fly, came up the path, and knocked at the door. Old Joan
answered it and showed him into the room. &ldquo;Captain
Amphlett,&rdquo; she said. Katrine looked ready to die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must apologize for intruding,&rdquo; he began, with a
pleasant voice and manner. &ldquo;My friend Edgar Reste is
staying here, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine was taken with a shivering fit. The stranger
looked at her with curiosity. I said she had been ill with
ague, and was about to add that Edgar Reste had left, when
Mr. Barbary came in. Captain Amphlett turned to him
and went on to explain: he was on his way to spend a little
time in one of the Midland shires, and had halted at
Evesham for the purpose of looking up Edgar Reste&mdash;from
whom he had been expecting to hear more than a week
past; could not understand why he did not. Mr. Barbary,
with all the courtesy of the finished gentleman, told him, in
reply to this, that Edgar Reste had left Caramel Cottage a
week ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried the stranger, evidently surprised.
&ldquo;And without writing to tell me. Was his departure
unexpected?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary laughed lightly. That man would have
retained his calmest presence of mind when going down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a wreck at sea. &ldquo;Some matter of business called him away,
I fancy,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to what part of England was he going?&rdquo; asked
Captain Amphlett, after a pause. &ldquo;Did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Barbary appeared to have an impulsive answer on his
lips, but closed them before he could speak it. He glanced
at me, and then turned his head and glanced at Katrine, as
if to see whether she was there, for he was sitting with his
back to her. A thought struck me that we were in the way
of his plain speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went to London,&rdquo; said Mr. Barbary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To London!&rdquo; echoed the Captain. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s
strange. He has not come to London, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can assure you it is where he told me he was going,&rdquo;
said Mr. Barbary, smiling. &ldquo;And it was to London his
luggage was addressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is altogether strange,&rdquo; repeated Captain
Amphlett. &ldquo;I went to his chambers in the Temple
yesterday, and Farnham, the barrister who shares them
with him, told me Reste was still in Worcestershire; he had
not heard from him for some time, and supposed he might
be returning any day now. Where in the world can he be
hiding himself? Had he come to London, as you suppose,
Mr. Barbary, he would have sought me out the first thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whiter than any ghost ever seen or heard of, had grown
Katrine as she listened. I could not take my eyes from
her terrified face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not comprehend it,&rdquo; resumed Captain Amphlett,
looking more helpless than a rudderless ship at sea. &ldquo;Are
you sure, sir, that there is no mistake; that he was really
going to London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all sure; only that he said it,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Barbary in a half mocking tone. &ldquo;One does not inquire
too closely, you know, into the private affairs of young men.
We have not heard from him yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand it at all,&rdquo; persisted Captain
Amphlett; &ldquo;or why he has not written to me; or where he
can have got to. He ought to have written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, no doubt,&rdquo; suavely remarked Mr. Barbary.
&ldquo;He was careless about letter-writing, I fancy. Can I offer
you any refreshment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None at all, thank you; I have no time to spare,&rdquo; said
the other, rising to depart. &ldquo;I suppose you do not chance
to know whether Reste had a letter from me last Tuesday
week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had one. It had some bank-notes in it. He
opened it here at the breakfast table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite a relief passed over Captain Amphlett&rsquo;s perplexed
face at the answer. &ldquo;I am glad to hear you say that, Mr.
Barbary. By his not acknowledging receipt of the money,
I feared it had miscarried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidding us good afternoon, and telling Katrine (at whose
sick state he had continued to glance curiously) that he
wished her better, the stranger walked rapidly out to his
fly, attended by Mr. Barbary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katrine,&rdquo; I asked, preparing to take my own departure,
&ldquo;what was there in Captain Amphlett to frighten you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it was the ague,&rdquo; she answered, bringing out the
words with a jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ague! Well, I&rsquo;d get rid of such an ague as that.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not ague; it was sheer fear, as common sense
told me, and I did not care to speculate upon it. An uneasy
atmosphere seemed to be hanging over Caramel Cottage
altogether; to have set in with Edgar Reste&rsquo;s departure.</p>

<p>A day or two later our people departed for Crabb Cot for
change of air for Lena, and we returned to school, so that
nothing more was seen or heard at present of the Barbarys.</p>

<p>December weather, and snow on the ground, and Caramel
Cottage looking cold and cheerless. Not so cheerless,
though, as poor Katrine, who had a blue, pinched face
and a bad cough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get her to rouse herself, or to swallow hardly a
morsel of food,&rdquo; lamented Joan to Mr. Duffham. &ldquo;She
sits like a statty all day long, sir, with her hands before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sits like a statue, does she?&rdquo; returned Duffham, who
could see it for himself, and for the hundredth time
wondered what it was she had upon her mind. He did
his best, no doubt, in the shape of tonics and lectures,
but he could make nothing of his patient. Katrine
vehemently denied that she was worrying herself over any
sweetheart&mdash;for that&rsquo;s how Duffham delicately shaped his
questions&mdash;and said it was the cold weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The voyage will set her up, or&mdash;<em>break</em> her up,&rdquo; decided
Duffham, who had never treated so unsatisfactory an invalid.
&ldquo;As to not having anything on her mind, why she
may tell that to the moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine was just dying of the trouble. The consciousness
of what the garden could disclose filled her with horror,
whilst the fear of discovery haunted her steps by day and
her dreams by night. She could not sleep alone, and Joan
had brought her mattress down to the room and lay on the
floor. When the sun shone, Mr. Barbary would compel
her to sit or walk in the garden; Katrine would turn sick
and faint at sight of that plot of ground under the apple
tree, and the winter greens growing there. At moments she
thought her father must suspect the source of her illness;
but he gave no sign of it. Since Captain Amphlett&rsquo;s visit,
no further inquiry had been made after Edgar Reste.
Katrine lived in daily dread of it. Now and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
neighbours would ask after him. Duffham had said one
day in the course of conversation: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that young
Reste now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, in London, working on for his silk
gown,&rdquo; Mr. Barbary lightly answered. Katrine marvelled
at his coolness.</p>

<p>Upon getting back to the Manor for Christmas we heard
that Mr. Barbary was quitting Church Dykely for Canada.
&ldquo;And the voyage will either kill or cure the child,&rdquo; said
Duffham, for it was he who gave us the news; &ldquo;she is in a
frightfully weak state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it ague still?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is more like nerves than ague,&rdquo; answered Duffham.
&ldquo;She seems to live in a chronic state of fear, starting and
shrinking at every unexpected sound. I can&rsquo;t make her out,
and that&rsquo;s the truth; she denies having received any shock.&mdash;So
you have never found Don, Squire!&rdquo; he broke off,
leaving the other subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Squire angrily. &ldquo;Dick Standish has been
too much for us this time. The fellow wants hanging.
Give him rope enough, and he&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brazer&rsquo;s dog was returned to him, safe and sound, but
our dog had never come back to us, and the Squire was
looking out for another. Dick Standish protested his innocence
yet; but he had gone roving the country with that other
dog, and no doubt had sold Don to somebody at a safe
distance. Perhaps had dyed him a fine gold first; as the
dyer dyed his dog at Evesham.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Katrine, there&rsquo;s not a bit of sense in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve. Katrine was sitting in the
twilight by the parlour fire, and Joan was scolding. She
had brought in a tray of tea with some bread-and-butter;
Katrine was glad enough of the tea, but said she could not
eat; she always said so now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be whipped if I can tell what has got into the child!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
stormed Joan. &ldquo;Do you want to starve yourself right out?&mdash;do
you want to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s papa,&rdquo; interrupted Katrine, as the house door
was heard to open. &ldquo;You must bring in more tea now,
Joan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This door opened next, and some one stood looking in.
Not Mr. Barbary. Katrine gazed with dilating eyes, as the
firelight flickered on the intruder&rsquo;s face: and then she caught
hold of Joan with an awful cry. For he who had come in
bore the semblance of Edgar Reste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Katrine, my dear, have you been ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katrine burst into hysterical tears as her terror passed.
She had been taking it for Mr. Reste&rsquo;s apparition, you see,
whereas it was Mr. Reste himself. Joan closed the shutters,
stirred the fire, and went away to see what she could do for
him in the shape of eatables after his journey. He sat
down by Katrine, and took her poor wan face to his sheltering
arms.</p>

<p>In the sobbing excitement of the moment, in the strangely
wonderful relief his presence brought, Katrine breathed
forth the truth; that she had seen him, as she believed,
<em>buried</em> under the summer-apple tree; had believed it all this
time, and that it had been slowly killing her. Mr. Reste
laughed a little at the idea of his being buried, and cleared
up matters in a few brief words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you never write?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being at issue with Mr. Barbary, I would not write to
him: and I thought, Katrine, that the less you were reminded
of me the better. I waited in London until my
luggage came up, and then went straight to Dieppe, without
having seen any one I knew; without having even shown
myself at my Chambers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why not, Edgar?&rdquo; she interrupted. Mr. Reste
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I had reasons. I had left a few outstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
accounts there, and was not then prepared to pay them and
I did not care to give a clue to my address to be bothered
with letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not even write to Captain Amphlett. He came
here to see after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote to him from Dieppe; not quite at first, though.
Buried under the apple-tree! that <em>is</em> a joke, Katrine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, I have said. We had gone through
the snow, with Mrs. Todhetley, to help the Miss Pages
decorate the church, and the Squire was alone after dinner,
when Mr. Reste was shown in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you!&rdquo; cried the Squire in hearty welcome. &ldquo;So
you have come down for Christmas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partly for that,&rdquo; answered Mr. Reste. &ldquo;Partly, sir, to
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see me! You are very good. I hope you&rsquo;ll dine
with us to-morrow, if Barbary will spare you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I don&rsquo;t know about that; I&rsquo;m afraid not. Anyway,
I have a tale to tell you first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sitting on the other side the fire, opposite the Squire, the
wine and walnuts on the table between them, he told the
tale of that past Tuesday night.</p>

<p>He had gone out with Barbary in a fit of foolishness, not
intending to do any harm to the game or to join in any
harm, though Barbary had insisted on his carrying a loaded
gun. The moon was remarkably bright. Not long had
they been out, going cautiously, when on drawing near Dyke
Neck, they became aware that some poachers were already
abroad, and that the keepers were tracking them; so there
was nothing for it but to steal back again. They had nearly
reached Caramel Cottage, and were making for the side
gate, when a huge dog flew up, barking. Barbary called
out that it was the Squire&rsquo;s dog, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; interjected the Squire at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, your dog, Don,&rdquo; continued Mr. Reste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
&ldquo;Barbary very foolishly kicked the dog: he was in a panic,
you see, lest the noise of its barking should bring up the
keepers. That kick must have enraged Don, and he
fastened savagely on Barbary&rsquo;s leg. I, fearing for Barbary&rsquo;s
life, or some lesser injury, grew excited, and fired at the
dog. It killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not daring to leave the dog at the gate, for it might
have betrayed us, we drew him across the yard to the brewhouse,
and locked the door upon him. But while doing
this, Ben Gibbon passed, and thereby learnt what had
happened. The next day, Barbary and I had some bickering
together. I wanted to come to you and confess the
truth openly; Barbary forbade it, saying it would ruin him:
we could bury the dog that night or the next, he said, and
nobody would ever be the wiser. In the evening, Gibbon
came in; he was all for Barbary&rsquo;s opinion, and opposed
mine. After he left, I and Barbary had a serious quarrel.
I said I would leave there and then; he resented it, and
followed me into the yard to try to keep me. But my
temper was up, and I set off to walk to Evesham, telling him
to send my traps after me, and to direct them to Euston
Square Station. I took the first morning train that passed
through Evesham for London, and made my mind up on the
journey to go abroad for a week or two. Truth to confess,&rdquo;
added the speaker, &ldquo;I felt a bit of a coward about the dog,
not knowing what proceedings you might take if it came to
light, and I deemed it as well to be out of the way for a
time. But I don&rsquo;t like being a coward, Mr. Todhetley, it is
a role I have never been used to, and I came down to-day
to confess all. Barbary is going away, so it will not damage
him: besides, it was really I who killed the dog, not he.
And now, sir, I throw myself upon your mercy. What do
you say to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the Squire, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in a rare good humour, and liked the young fellow besides.
&ldquo;It was a bad thing to do&mdash;poor faithful Don! But it&rsquo;s
Christmas-tide, so I suppose we must say no more about it.
Let bygones be bygones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edgar Reste grasped his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbary&rsquo;s off to Canada, we are told,&rdquo; said the Squire.
&ldquo;A better country for him than this. He has not been
thought much of in this place, as you probably know. And
it&rsquo;s to be hoped that poor little maiden of his will get up
her health again, which seems, by all accounts, to be much
shattered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll get that up now,&rdquo; said Mr. Reste, with a
curious smile. &ldquo;She is not going out with him, sir; she
stays behind with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you!&rdquo; cried the Squire, staring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just asked her to be my wife, and she says, Yes,&rdquo;
said Mr. Reste. &ldquo;An old uncle of mine over in India has
died; he has left me a few hundreds a year, so that I
can afford to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the Squire, heartily.
&ldquo;Poor Don, though! And what did Barbary do with
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buried him in his back garden, under the summer-apple
tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming home from our night&rsquo;s work at this juncture, we
found, to our surprise, a great dog fastened to the strong
iron garden bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a magnificent dog!&rdquo; exclaimed Tod, while the
mother sprang back in alarm. &ldquo;It is something like Don.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very much like Don. Quite as large, and handsomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall take it in, Johnny; the Pater would like to see it,
There, mother, you go in first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod unfastened the dog and took it into the dining-room,
where sat Mr. Reste. The dog seemed a gentle creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and went about looking at us all with his intelligent eyes.
Mrs. Todhetley stroked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is a nice dog!&rdquo; cried the Squire. &ldquo;Whose is
it, lads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is yours, sir, if you will accept him from me,&rdquo; said Mr.
Reste. &ldquo;I came across him in London the other day, and
thought you might like him in place of Don. I have taught
him to answer to the same name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call him &lsquo;Don the Second&rsquo;&mdash;and I thank you
heartily,&rdquo; said the Squire, with a beaming face. &ldquo;Good
Don! Good old fellow! You shall be made much of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He married Katrine without much delay, taking her off
to London to be nursed up; and Mr. Barbary set sail for
Canada. The bank-notes, you ask about? Why, what
Katrine saw in her father&rsquo;s hands were but <em>half</em> the notes,
for Mr. Reste divided them the day they arrived, giving
thirty pounds to his host, and keeping thirty himself. And
Dick Standish, for once, had not been in the fight; and the
Squire, meeting him in the turnip-field on Christmas Day,
gave him five shillings for a Christmas-box. Which elated
Dick beyond telling; and the Squire was glad of it later,
when poor Dick had gone away prematurely to the Better
Land.</p>

<p>And all the sympathy Katrine had from her father, when
he came to hear about the summer-apple tree, was a sharp
wish that she could have had her ridiculous ideas shaken
out of her.</p>

<h2>A TRAGEDY</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;GERVAIS PREEN</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Crabb Cot, Squire Todhetley&rsquo;s estate in Worcestershire, lay
close to North Crabb, and from two to three miles off Islip,
both of which places you have heard of already. Half way
on the road to Islip from Crabb, a side road, called Brook
Lane, branched straight off on the left towards unknown
wilds, for the parts there were not at all frequented. Passing
a solitary homestead here and there, Brook Lane would
bring you at the end of less than two miles to a small hamlet,
styled Duck Brook.</p>

<p>I am not responsible for the name. I don&rsquo;t know who is.
It was called Duck Brook long before my time, and will be,
no doubt, long after I have left time behind me. The village
rustics called it Duck Bruck.</p>

<p>Duck Brook proper contains some twenty or thirty houses,
mostly humble dwellings, built in the form of a triangle, and
two or three shops. A set of old stocks for the correction
of the dead-and-gone evil-doers might be seen still, and a
square pound in which to imprison stray cattle. And I would
remark, as it may be of use further on, that the distance from
Duck Brook to either Islip or Crabb was about equal&mdash;some
three miles, or so; it stood at right angles between them.
Passing down Brook Lane (which was in fact a fairly wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
turnpike road) into the high road, turning to the right would
bring you to Crabb; turning to the left, to Islip.</p>

<p>Just before coming to that populous part of Duck Brook,
the dwelling places, there stood in a garden facing the
road a low, wide, worn house, its bricks dark with age, and
now partly covered with ivy, which had once been the abode
of a flourishing farmer. The land on which this lay belonged
to a Captain Falkner&mdash;some hundred acres of it. The Captain
was in difficulties and, afraid to venture into England,
resided abroad.</p>

<p>A Mr. Preen lived in the house now&mdash;Gervais Preen, a
gentleman by descent. The Preens were Worcestershire
people; and old Mr. Preen, dead now, had left a large
family of sons and daughters, who had for the most part
nothing to live upon. How or where Gervais Preen had
lately lived, no one knew much about; some people said it
was London, some thought it was Paris; but he suddenly
came back to Worcestershire and took up his abode, much
to the general surprise, at this old farmhouse at Duck Brook.
It was soon known that he lived in it rent-free, having undertaken
the post of agent to Captain Falkner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agent to Captain Falkner&mdash;what a mean thing for a
Preen to do!&rdquo; cried Islip and Crabb all in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all mean; gentlemen must live as well as other
people,&rdquo; warmly disputed the Squire. &ldquo;I honour Preen for
it.&rdquo; And he was the first to walk over to Duck Brook and
shake hands with him.</p>

<p>Others followed the Squire&rsquo;s example, but Mr. Preen did
not seem inclined to be sociable. He was forty-five years
old then; a little shrimp of a man with a dark face, small
eyes like round black beads, and a very cross look. He met
his visitors civilly, for he was a gentleman, but he let it be
known that he and his wife did not intend to visit or be visited.
The Squire pressed him to bring Mrs. Preen to a friendly
dinner at Crabb Cot; but he refused emphatically, frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
saying that as they could not afford to entertain in return, they
should not themselves go out to entertainments.</p>

<p>Thus Gervais Preen and his wife began their career at
Duck Brook, keeping themselves to themselves, locked up in
lavender, so to say, as if they did not want the world outside
to remember their existence. Perhaps that was the ruling
motive, for he owed a few debts of long standing. One or
two creditors had found him out, and were driving, it was
said, a hard bargain with him, insisting upon payment by
degrees if it could not be handed over in a lump.</p>

<p>But there was one member of the family who declined to
keep herself laid up in lavender, and that was the only
daughter, Jane. She came to Crabb Cot of her own accord,
and made friends with us; made friends with Mrs. Jacob
Chandler and her girls, and with Emma Paul at Islip. She
was a fair, lively, open-natured girl, and welcomed everywhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Preen and Jane were seated at the breakfast-table
one fine morning in the earliest days of spring. A
space of about two years had gone by since they first came
to Duck Brook. Breakfast was laid, as usual, in a small
flagged room opening from the kitchen. A piece of cold
boiled bacon, three eggs, a home-made loaf and a pat of
butter were on the table, nothing more luxurious. Mrs. Preen,
a thin woman, under the middle height, poured out the coffee.
She must once have been very pretty. Her face was fair and
smooth still, with a bright rose tint on the cheeks, and a
peevish look in her mild blue eyes. Jane&rsquo;s face was very
much like her mother&rsquo;s, but her blue eyes had no peevishness
in them as yet. Poor Mrs. Preen&rsquo;s life was one of rubs and
crosses, had been for a long while, and that generally leaves
its marks upon the countenance. When Mr. Preen came in
he had a letter in his hand, which he laid beside his plate,
address downwards. He looked remarkably cross, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not speak. No one else spoke. Conversation was seldom
indulged in at meal times, unless the master chose to begin
it. But in passing something to him, Jane&rsquo;s eyes chanced to
fall on the letter, and saw that it was of thin, foreign paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, is that from Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it is?&rdquo; returned Mr. Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;is anything different decided?&rdquo; asked Mrs Preen,
timidly, as if she were afraid of either the question or the
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is there different to decide?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Gervais, I thought you wrote to say that he could
not come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he writes back to say that he must come. I suppose
he must. The house over there is being given up; he
can&rsquo;t take up his abode in the street. There&rsquo;s what he says,&rdquo;
continued Mr. Preen, tossing the letter to the middle of the
table for the public benefit. &ldquo;He will be here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glad light flashed into Jane&rsquo;s countenance. She lifted
her handkerchief to hide it.</p>

<p>Oliver Preen was her brother; she and he were the only
children. He had been partly adopted by a great aunt, once
Miss Emily Preen, the sister of his grandfather. She had
married Major Magnus late in life, and was left a widow.
Since Oliver left school, three years ago now, he had lived
with Mrs. Magnus at Tours, where she had settled down.
She was supposed to be well off; and the Preen family&mdash;Gervais
Preen and all his hungry brothers and sisters&mdash;had
cherished expectations from her. They thought she
might provide slenderly for Oliver, and divide the rest of her
riches among them. But a week or two ago she had died
after a short illness, and then the amazing fact came out that
she had nothing to leave. All Mrs. Magnus once possessed
had been sunk in an annuity on her own life.</p>

<p>This was bad enough for the brothers and the sisters, but
it was nothing compared with the shock it gave to him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Duck Brook. For you see he had to take his son back now
and provide for him; and Oliver had been brought up to do
nothing. A mild young man, he, we understood, not at all
clever enough to set the Thames on fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen finished his breakfast and left the room, carrying
the letter with him. Jane went at once into the garden,
which in places was no better than a wilderness, and ran
about the sheltered paths that were out of sight of the
windows, and jumped up to catch the lower branches of trees,
all in very happiness. She and Oliver were intensely attached
to one another; she had not seen him for three years, and
now they were going to meet again. To-morrow! oh, to-morrow!
To-morrow, and he would be here! She should
see him face to face!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo; called out a stern voice, &ldquo;I want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In half a moment Jane had appeared in the narrow front
path that led between beds of sweet but common flowers from
the entrance gate in the centre of the palings to the door of
the house, and was walking up demurely. Mr. Preen was
standing at an open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; she said. And Mr. Preen only answered by
looking at her and shutting down the window.</p>

<p>The door opened into a passage, which led straight
through to the back of the house. On the left, as you
entered, was the parlour; on the right was the room which
Mr. Preen used as an office, in which were kept the account
books and papers relating to the estate. It was a square
room, lighted by two tall narrow windows. A piece of
matting covered the middle of the floor, and on it stood Mr.
Preen&rsquo;s large flat writing-table, inlaid with green leather.
Shelves and pigeon-holes filled one side of the walls, and a
few chairs stood about. Altogether the room had a cold,
bare look.</p>

<p>It was called the &ldquo;Buttery.&rdquo; When Mr. and Mrs. Preen
first came to the house, the old man who had had charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
showed them over it. &ldquo;This is the parlour,&rdquo; he said,
indicating the room they were then looking at; &ldquo;and this,&rdquo;
he added, opening the door on the opposite side of the
passage, &ldquo;is the Buttery.&rdquo; Jane laughed: but they had
adopted the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want these letters copied, Jane,&rdquo; said Mr. Preen, who
was now sitting at his table, his back to the fire, and the
windows in front of him; and he handed to her two letters
which he had just written.</p>

<p>Jane took her seat at the table opposite to him. Whenever
Mr. Preen wanted letters copied, he called upon her to
do it. Jane did not much like the task; she was not fond of
writing, and was afraid of making mistakes.</p>

<p>When she had finished the letters this morning she
escaped to her mother, asking how she could help in the
preparations for Oliver. They kept one maid-servant; a
capless young lady of sixteen, who wore a frock and pinafore
of a morning. There was Sam as well; a well-grown civil
youth, whose work lay chiefly out of doors.</p>

<p>The day passed. The next day was passing. From an
early hour Jane Preen had watched for the guest&rsquo;s arrival.
In the afternoon, when she was weary of looking and looking
in vain, she put on a warm shawl and her pink sun-bonnet
and went out of doors with a book.</p>

<p>A little lower down, towards the Islip Road, Brook Lane
was flanked on one side by a grove of trees, too dense to
admit of penetration. But there were two straight paths in
them at some distance from each other, which would carry
you to the back of the grove, and to the stream running
parallel with the highway in front; from which stream Duck
Brook derived its name. These openings in the trees were
called Inlets curiously. A few worn benches stood in front
of the trees, and also behind them, and had been there for
ages. If you took your seat upon one of the front benches,
you could watch the passing and re-passing (if there chanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to be any) on the high road; if you preferred a seat at the
back, you might contemplate the pellucid stream and the
meads beyond it, like any knight or fair damsel of romance.</p>

<p>This was a favourite resort of Jane Preen&rsquo;s, a slight relief
from the dullness at home. She generally sat by the stream,
but to-day faced the road, for she was looking for Oliver.
It was not a frequented road at all, but I think this has been
said; sometimes an hour would pass away and not so much
as a farmer&rsquo;s horse and cart jolt by, or a beggar shambling
on foot.</p>

<p>Jane had brought out a favourite book of the day, one of
Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s, which had been lent to her by Miss Julietta
Chandler. Shall we ever have such writers again? Compare
a work over which a tremendous fuss is made in the present
day with one of those romances or novels of the past when
some of us were young&mdash;works written by Scott, and Bulwer,
and others I need not mention. Why, they were as solid
gold compared with silver and tinsel.</p>

<p>Jane tried to lose herself in the romantic love of Lucy
and Paul, or in the passionate love-letters of Sir William
Brandon, written when he was young; and she could not do
so. Her eyes kept turning, first to that way of the road, then
to this: she did not know which way Oliver would come.
By rail to Crabb station she supposed, and then with a fly
onwards; though being strange to the neighbourhood he
might pitch upon any out-of-the-way route and so delay his
arrival.</p>

<p>Suddenly her heart stopped beating and then coursed on
to fever heat. A fly was winding along towards her in the
distance, from the direction of Crabb. Jane rose and
waited close to the path. It was not Oliver. Three ladies
and a child sat in the fly. They all stared at her, evidently
wondering who she was and what she did there. She went
back to the bench, but did not open her book again.</p>

<p>It must be nearing four o&rsquo;clock: she could tell it by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
sun, for she had no watch: and she thought she would go
in. Slowly taking up the book, she was turning towards
home, which was close by, when upon giving a lingering
farewell look down the road, a solitary foot passenger came
into view: a gentlemanly young man, with an umbrella in
his hand and a coat on his arm.</p>

<p><em>Was</em> it Oliver? She was not quite sure at first. He was
of middle height, slight and slender: had a mild fair face
and blue eyes with a great sadness in them. Jane noticed
the sadness at once, and thought she remembered it; she
thought the face also like her own and her mother&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane! Why&mdash;is it you? I did not expect to find you
under that peasant bonnet, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They clung to each other, kissing fondly, tears in the eyes
of both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why are you walking, Oliver? Did you come to
Crabb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I might as well walk; I did
not think it was quite so far. The porter will send on my
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was just a year between them; Oliver would be
twenty-one in a month, Jane was twenty-two, but did not
look as much. She took his arm as they walked home.</p>

<p>As she halted at the little gate, Oliver paused in surprise
and gazed about: at the plain wooden palings painted
green, which shut in the crowded, homely garden; at the
old farmhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <em>this</em> the place, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You have not been picturing it a palace, have
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver laughed, and held back the low gate for her. But
as he passed in after her, a perceptible shiver shook his
frame. It was gone in a moment; but in that moment it
had shaken him from head to foot. Jane saw it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you have not caught a chill, Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all; I am warm with my walk. I don&rsquo;t know
why I should have shivered,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It was like the
feeling you have when people say somebody&rsquo;s &lsquo;walking
over your grave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen received his son coldly, but not unkindly; Mrs.
Preen did the same; she was led by her husband&rsquo;s example
in all things. Tea, though it was so early, was prepared at
once, with a substantial dish for the traveller; and they sat
down to it in the parlour.</p>

<p>It was a long room with a beam running across the low
ceiling. A homely room, with a coarse red-and-green carpet
and horse-hair chairs. A few ornaments of their own (for
the furniture belonged to the house), relics of better days,
were disposed about; and Jane had put on the table a glass
of early primroses. The two windows, tall and narrow,
answered to those in the Buttery. Oliver surveyed the
room in silent dismay: it wore so great a contrast to
the French salons at Tours to which he was accustomed.
He gave them the details of his aunt&rsquo;s death and of her
affairs.</p>

<p>When tea was over, Mr. Preen shut himself into the
Buttery; Mrs. Preen retired to the kitchen to look after
Nancy, who had to be watched, like most young servants,
as you watch a sprightly calf. Jane and Oliver went out
again, Jane taking the way to the Inlets. This time she sat
down facing the brook. The dark trees were behind them,
the clear stream flowed past in a gentle murmur; nothing
but fields beyond. It was a solitary spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call this place&mdash;the Inlets?&rdquo; cried Oliver.
&ldquo;Why is it called so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know: because of those two openings
from the road, I suppose. I like to sit here; it is so quiet.
Oliver, how came Aunt Emily to sink all her money in an
annuity?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For her own benefit, of course; it nearly doubled her
income. She did it years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you did not know that she had nothing to
leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knew. She kept the secret well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very unfortunate for <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;compared with what I had expected,&rdquo; sighed
Oliver. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, Jane, and I try not to feel
disappointed. Aunt Emily in life was very kind to me;
apart from all selfish consideration I regret and mourn her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will hardly endure this dreary place after your gay
and happy life at Tours, Oliver. Duck Brook is the fag-end
of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not appear to be very lively,&rdquo; remarked Oliver,
with a certain dry sarcasm. &ldquo;How was it that the Pater
came to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know&mdash;it was a living, and we had nothing
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Uncle Gilbert died, there was no other of our
uncles, those who were left, who could help papa; at least
they said so; and I assure you we fell into great embarrassment
as the weeks went on. It was impossible to remain in
Jersey; we could pay no one; and what would have been
the ending but for papa&rsquo;s falling in with Captain Falkner, I
can&rsquo;t imagine. Captain Falkner owns a good deal of land
about here; but he is in difficulties himself and cannot be
here to look after it; so he offered papa the agency and a
house to live in. I can tell you, Oliver, it was as a godsend
to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that my father is an agent?&rdquo; cried
the young man, his face dyed with a red flush.</p>

<p>Jane nodded. &ldquo;That, and nothing less. He looks after
the estate and is paid a hundred pounds a-year salary, and
we live rent free. Lately he has taken something else,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
something different; the agency of some new patent
agricultural implements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver Preen looked very blank. He had been living the
life of a gentleman, was imbued with a gentleman&rsquo;s notions,
and this news brought him the most intense mortification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will expect you to help him in the Buttery,&rdquo; continued
Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Buttery,&rdquo; laughed Jane. &ldquo;It is the room where
papa keeps his accounts and writes his letters. Letters
come in nearly every morning now, inquiring about the new
agricultural implements; papa has to answer them, and
wants some of his answers copied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has only a hundred a year!&rdquo; murmured Oliver,
unable to get over that one item of information. &ldquo;Aunt
Emily had from eight to nine hundred, and lived up to her
income.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst is that we cannot spend all the hundred.
Papa has back debts upon him. Have you brought home
any money, Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None to speak of,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;there was none to
bring. Aunt Emily&rsquo;s next quarter&rsquo;s instalment would have
been due this week; but she died first, you see. She lived
in a furnished house; and as to the few things she had of
her own, and her personal trinkets, Aunt Margaret Preen
came down and swooped upon them. Jane, how have you
managed to put up with the lively state of affairs here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this lively spot&mdash;the fag-end of the world. It was
Emma Paul first called it so. I put up with it because I
can&rsquo;t help myself, Oliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Emma Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The daughter of Lawyer Paul, of Islip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Oliver, slightingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the nicest girl in the world,&rdquo; added Jane.
&ldquo;But I can tell you this much, Oliver,&rdquo; she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
after a pause: &ldquo;when we came first to Duck Brook it
seemed to me as a haven of refuge. Our life in Jersey had
become intolerable, our life here was peaceful&mdash;no angry
creditors, no daily applications for debts that we could not
pay. Here we were free and happy, and it gave me a
liking for the place. It is dull, of course; but I go pretty
often to see Emma Paul, or to take tea at Mrs. Jacob
Chandler&rsquo;s, and at Crabb Cot when the Todhetleys are
staying there. Sam brings the gig for me in the evening,
when I don&rsquo;t walk home. You will have to bring it for
me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a gig, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa has to keep that for his own use in going about
the land: sometimes he rides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the debts in Jersey paid, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shadow passed over her face, and her voice dropped to
a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It makes me feel very unhappy sometimes, half-frightened.
Of course papa hopes he shall not be found out
here. But he seems to have also two or three old debts in
this neighbourhood, and those he is paying off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun, setting right before them in a sea of red clouds,
fell upon their faces and lighted up the sadness of Oliver&rsquo;s.
Then the red ball sank, on its way to cheer and illumine
another part of the world, leaving behind it the changes
which set in after sunset. The bright stream became grey,
the osiers bordering it grew dark. Oliver shook himself.
The whole place to him wore a strange air of melancholy.
It was early evening yet, for the month was only February;
but the spring had come in with a kindly mood, and the
weather was bright.</p>

<p>Rising from the bench, they slowly walked up the nearest
Inlet, side by side, and gained the high road just as a pony-chaise
was passing by, an elderly gentleman and a young
lady in it; Mr. and Miss Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, please pull up!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
Jane Preen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaped out, almost before the pony had stopped, and
ran to the pathway with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How pleasant that we should meet you, Jane! Papa
has been taking me for a drive this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver stood apart, behind his sister, looking and listening.
The speaker was one of the prettiest girls he had ever seen,
with a blushing, dimpled face, a smiling mouth displaying
small white teeth, shy blue eyes, and bright hair. Her
straw hat had blue ribbons and her dress was one of light
silk. Never in his life, thought Oliver, had he seen so
sweet a face or heard so sweet a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been for a walk?&rdquo; she asked of Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jane. &ldquo;We have been down the Inlet,
and sitting to watch the sun set. This is my brother,
Emma, of whom you have heard. He arrived this afternoon,
and has left Tours. Will you allow me to introduce him to
you? Oliver, this is Miss Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Oliver Preen was about to execute a deep bow at
a respectful distance, after the manner of the fashionable
blades of Tours, and swung off his hat to begin with; but
Emma Paul, who was not fashionable at all, but sociable,
inexperienced and unpretending, held out her hand. She
liked his looks; a slender young fellow, in deep mourning,
with a fair, mild, pleasing face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said, turning to the gig, which had drawn up
close to the foot-path, &ldquo;this is Mr. Oliver Preen, from
France. He has come home, Jane says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Paul, a portly, elderly gentleman, with iron-grey
hair and a face that looked stern to those who did not know
him, bent forward and shook hands with the stranger.</p>

<p>Emma began plunging into all sorts of gossip, for she
liked nothing better than to talk. Jane liked it too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been telling Oliver we call Duck Brook the fag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
end of the world, and that it was you who first said it,&rdquo;
cried Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how could you?&rdquo; laughed Emma, turning her
beaming face upon Oliver. And they might have gone on
for ever, if left alone; but Mr. Paul reminded his daughter
that it was growing late, and he wanted to get home to
dinner. So she lightly stepped into the low chaise, Oliver
Preen assisting her, and they drove off, Emma calling to
Jane not to forget that they were engaged to drink tea at
North Villa on the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Preen going to do with that young fellow?&rdquo;
wondered the lawyer, as he drove on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, papa,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;Take him
into the Buttery, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Paul laughed a little at the idea. &ldquo;Not much more
work there than Preen can do himself, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I last saw Jane she said she thought her brother
might be coming home. It may be only for a visit, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Paul nodded, and touched up the pony.</p>

<p>Oliver stood in the pathway gazing after the chaise until
it was out of sight. &ldquo;What a charming girl!&rdquo; he cried to
his sister. &ldquo;I never saw one so unaffected in all my life.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>If the reader has chanced to read the two papers entitled
&ldquo;Chandler and Chandler,&rdquo; he may be able to recall North
Villa, and those who lived in it.</p>

<p>It stood in the Islip Road&mdash;hardly a stone&rsquo;s throw from
Crabb Cot. Jacob Chandler&rsquo;s widow lived in it with her
three daughters. She was empty-headed, vain, frivolous,
always on the high ropes when in company, wanting to give
people the impression that she had been as good as born
a duchess: whereas everyone knew she had sprung from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
small tradespeople in Birmingham. The three daughters,
Clementina, Georgiana, Julietta, took after her, and were as
fine as their names.</p>

<p>But you have heard of them before&mdash;and of the wrong
inflicted by their father, Jacob Chandler, upon his brother&rsquo;s
widow and son. The solicitor&rsquo;s business at Islip had been
made by the elder brother, Thomas Chandler; he had taken
Jacob into partnership, and given him a half share without
cross or coin of recompense: and when Thomas died from
an accident, leaving his only son Tom in the office to
succeed him when he should be of age, Jacob refused to
carry out the behest. Ignoring past obligations, all sense
of right or wrong, he made his own son Valentine his
partner in due course of time, condemning Tom, though
a qualified solicitor, to remain his clerk.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that when Jacob Chandler lay on his death-bed,
the full sense of what he had done came home to him: any
glaring injustice we may have been committing in our lives
does, I fancy, often take hold of the conscience at that
dread time: and he enjoined his son Valentine to give
Tom his due&mdash;a full partnership. Valentine having his late
father&rsquo;s example before him (for Jacob died), did nothing
of the kind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll raise your salary, Tom,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
I cannot make you my partner.&rdquo; So Tom, thinking he had
put up with injustice long enough, quitted Valentine there
and then. John Paul, the other Islip lawyer, was only too
glad to secure Tom for his own office; he made him his
manager and paid him a good salary.</p>

<p>About two years had gone on since then. Tom Chandler,
a very fine young fellow, honest and good-natured, was
growing more and more indispensable to Mr. Paul;
Valentine was growing (if the expression may be used)
downwards. For Valentine, who had been an indulged
son, and only made to work when he pleased, had picked
up habits of idleness, and other habits that we are told in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
our copy-books idleness begets. Gay, handsome, pleasant-mannered,
with money always in his pocket, one of those
young men sure to be courted, Valentine had grown fonder
of pleasure than of work: he liked his game at billiards;
worse than that, he liked his glass. When a client came in,
ten to one but a clerk had to make a rush to the Bell Inn
opposite, to fetch his master; and it sometimes happened
that Valentine would not return quite steady. The result
was, that his practice was gradually leaving him, to be given
to Mr. Paul. All this was telling upon Valentine&rsquo;s mother;
she had an ever-haunting dread of the poverty which might
result in the future, and was only half as pretentious as she
used to be.</p>

<p>Her daughters did not allow their minds to be disturbed
by anxiety as yet; the young are less anxious than the old.
When she dropped a word of apprehension in their hearing,
they good-humouredly said mamma was fidgety&mdash;Valentine
would be all right; if a little gay now it was only what other
young men were. It was a pleasant house to visit, for the
girls were gay and hospitable; though they did bedeck themselves
like so many peacocks, and put on airs and graces.</p>

<p>Jane Preen found it pleasant; had found it so long ago;
and she introduced Oliver to it, who liked it because he
sometimes met Emma Paul there. It took a very short
time indeed after that first meeting by the Inlets for him to
be over head and ears in love with her. Thus some weeks
went on.</p>

<p>More pure and ardent love than that young fellow&rsquo;s for
Emma was never felt by man or woman. It filled his every
thought, seemed to sanctify his dreary days at Duck Brook,
and made a heaven of his own heart. He would meet her
at North Villa, would encounter her sometimes in her walks,
now and then saw her at her own house at Islip. Not
often&mdash;old Mr. Paul did not particularly care for the Preens,
and rarely gave Emma leave to invite them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Emma did not care for <em>him</em>. She had not found out that
he cared for her. A remarkably open, pleasant girl in
manner, to him as to all the world, she met him always
with frank cordiality&mdash;and he mistook that natural cordiality
for a warmer feeling. Had Emma Paul suspected his love
for her she would have turned from it in dismay; she was
no coquette, and all the first love of her young heart was
privately given to someone else.</p>

<p>At this time there was a young man in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office
named Richard MacEveril. He was a nephew of Captain
MacEveril of Oak Mansion&mdash;a pretty place near Islip.
Captain MacEveril&mdash;a retired captain in the Royal Navy&mdash;had
a brother settled in Australia. When this brother
died, his only son, Richard, came over to his relatives,
accompanied by a small income, about enough to keep him
in coats and waistcoats.</p>

<p>The arrival very much put out Captain MacEveril. He
was a good-hearted man, but afflicted with gout in the
feet, and irascible when twinges took him. Naturally the
question arose to his mind&mdash;how was he to put Richard in
the way of getting bread and cheese. Richard seemed to
have less idea of how it was to be done than his uncle and
aunt had. They told him he must go back to Australia
and find a living there. Richard objected; said he had
only just left it, and did not like Australia. Upon the
captain&rsquo;s death, whenever that should take place, Richard
would come into a small estate of between two and three
hundred a-year, of which nothing could deprive him; for
Captain MacEveril had no son; only a daughter, who would
be rich through her mother.</p>

<p>Richard was a gay-mannered young fellow and much
liked, but he was not very particular. He played billiards
at the Bell Inn with Valentine Chandler, with young Scott,
and with other idlers; he hired horses, and dashed across
country on their backs; he spent money in all ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
When his own ready money was gone he went into debt,
and people came to the Captain to ask him to liquidate it.
This startled and angered the old post-captain as no twinge
of gout had ever yet done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something must be done with Dick,&rdquo; said Mrs. MacEveril.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it must,&rdquo; her husband wrathfully retorted;
&ldquo;but what the deuce is it to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get John Paul to take him into his office as a
temporary thing? It would keep him out of mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. MacEveril&rsquo;s suggestion bore fruit. For the present,
until something eligible should &ldquo;turn up,&rdquo; Dick was placed
in the lawyer&rsquo;s office as a copying clerk. Mr. Paul made a
favour of taking him in; but he and Captain MacEveril had
been close friends for many a year. Dick wrote a bold,
clear hand, good for copying deeds.</p>

<p>He and Oliver became intimate. It is said that a fellow-feeling
makes us wondrous kind, and they could feel for one
another. Both were down in life, both had poverty-stricken
pockets. They were of the same age, twenty-one, and in
appearance were not dissimilar&mdash;fair of face, slight in
person.</p>

<p>So that Oliver Preen needed no plea for haunting Islip
three or four times a week. &ldquo;He went over to see Dick
MacEveril,&rdquo; would have been his answer had any inquisitive
body inquired what he did there: while, in point of fact, he
went hoping to see Emma Paul&mdash;if by delightful chance he
might obtain that boon.</p>

<p>Thus matters were going on: Oliver, shut up the earlier
part of the day in the Buttery with his father, answering
letters, and what not; in the latter part of it he would be
at Islip, or perhaps with Jane at North Villa. Sometimes
they would walk home together; or, if they could have the
gig, Oliver drove his sister back in it. But for the love he
bore Emma, he would have found his life intolerable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
nothing but depression, mortification, disappointment: but
when Love takes up its abode in the heart the dreariest lot
becomes one of sunshine.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The garden attached to North Villa was large and very old-fashioned:
a place crowded with trees and shrubs, intersected
with narrow paths and homely flowers. The Malvern hills
could be seen in the distance, as beautiful a sight in the
early morning, with the lights and shadows lying upon them,
as the world can show.</p>

<p>It was summer now, nearly midsummer. The garish day
was fading, the summer moon had risen, its round shield
so delicately pale as to look like silver; and Valentine
Chandler was pacing the garden with Jane Preen in the
moonlight. They had been singing a duet together at
the piano, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wandered in dreams,&rdquo; and he had taken
the accompaniment. He played well; and never living
man had sweeter voice than he. They were wandering
in dreams of their own, those two, had been for some
time now.</p>

<p>Silence between them as they paced the walk; a sort of
discomforting, ominous silence. Valentine broke it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you reproach me, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I ever reproach you?&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But you ought to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would only keep your promises, Valentine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Mr. Valentine Chandler, having stayed his steps
while they spoke, backed against the corner of the latticed
arbour, which they were just then passing. The same
arbour in which his aunt, Mrs. Mary Ann Cramp, had sat in
her copper-coloured silk gown to convict her brother Jacob,
Valentine&rsquo;s father, of his sins against Tom Chandler, one
Sunday afternoon, not so very long gone by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Val did not answer. He seemed to be staring at the
moon, to investigate what it was made of. In reality he
saw no moon; neither moon, nor sky above, nor any earthly
thing beneath; he only saw his own reckless folly in his
mind&rsquo;s clouded mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you do make promises, Valentine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I make them I fully mean to keep them; but
a lot of idle fellows get hold of me, and&mdash;and&mdash;I <em>can&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo;
said he, in a savage tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you might,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;If I made promises I
should keep them to you&mdash;whatever the temptation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think who it is that comes tattling to you about
me, Jane! Is it Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oliver! Never. Oliver does not know, or suspect&mdash;anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it must be those confounded girls indoors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor they, either. It is not anyone in particular,
Valentine; but I hear one and another talking about
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what they say. You must tell
me, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane caught her breath, as if she did not like to answer.
But Valentine was waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say you are not steady, Val,&rdquo; she spoke in a
whisper; &ldquo;that you neglect your business; that unless you
pull up, you will go to the bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few moments Valentine remained quite still; you
might have thought he had gone to sleep. Then he put out
his hand, drew Jane gently to him, and bent down his head
to her with a long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>will</em> pull up, Jane. It is not as bad as story-tellers
make out. But I will pull up; I promise you; and I&rsquo;ll
begin from this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane Preen did not like to remind him that he had said
the same thing many times before; rather would she trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to his renewed word. When a girl is in love, she has faith
in modern miracles.</p>

<p>Valentine held her to him very closely. &ldquo;You believe
me, don&rsquo;t you, my darling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Down came a voice to them from some remote path near
the house, that was anything but a whisper. &ldquo;Jane! Jane
Preen! Are you in the garden? or are you upstairs with
Julietta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane stole swiftly forward. &ldquo;I am here, Clementina&mdash;it
is cool and pleasant in the night air. Do you want me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your boy is asking how long he is to wait. The horse
is fresh this evening, and won&rsquo;t stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the gig come!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, as she met Miss
Clementina. &ldquo;And has Sam brought it! Why not
Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clementina Chandler shook her head and the yellow
ribbons which adorned it, intimating that she did not know
anything about Oliver. It was the servant boy, Sam, who
had brought the gig.</p>

<p>Jane hastily put on her bonnet and scarf, said good night,
and was helped into the gig by Valentine&mdash;who gave her
hand a tender squeeze as they drove off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Oliver?&rdquo; she inquired of Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Oliver was out, Miss Jane. As it was getting late,
the missis told me to get the gig ready, and bring it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, Jane was silent, thinking about Valentine and
his renewed promises. It might be that the air was favourable
to love catching: anyway, both the young Preens had
fallen desperately into it; Jane with Valentine Chandler and
Oliver with Emma Paul.</p>

<p>Duck Brook was soon reached, for the horse was swift
that evening. On the opposite side of the road to the Inlets,
was a large field, in which the grass was down and lying in
cocks, the sweet smell of the hay perfuming the air of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
summer night. Leaping across this field and then over its
five-barred gate into the road, came Oliver Preen. Jane,
seeing him, had no need to wonder where he had been.</p>

<p>For across this field and onwards, as straight as the crow
flies, was a near way to Islip. Active legs, such as Oliver&rsquo;s,
might get over the ground in twenty minutes, perhaps in less.
But there was no path, or right of way; he had to push
through hedges and charge private grounds, with other
impediments attending. Thomas Chandler, Conveyancer
and Attorney-at-law, had laughingly assured Oliver that if
caught using that way, he would of a surety be had up
before the justices of the peace for trespass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop here, Sam,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I will get out now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam stopped the gig, and Jane got down. She joined
her brother, and the boy drove on to the stables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was too bad, Oliver, not to come for me!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant to be home in time; I did indeed, Jane,&rdquo; he
answered; &ldquo;but somehow the evening slipped on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you at Mr. Paul&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I was with MacEveril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At billiards, I suppose!&mdash;and it&rsquo;s very foolish of you,
Oliver, for you know you can&rsquo;t afford billiards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford anything, Janey, as it seems to me,&rdquo;
returned Oliver, kicking up the dust in the road as they
walked along. &ldquo;Billiards don&rsquo;t cost much; it&rsquo;s only the
tables: anyway, MacEveril paid for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has MacEveril talked any more about going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He talks of nothing else; is full of it,&rdquo; answered Oliver.
&ldquo;His uncle says he is not to go; and old Paul stopped him
at the first half-word, saying he could not be spared from the
office. Dick says he shall start all the same, leave or no
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick will be very silly to go just now, when we are
about to be so gay,&rdquo; remarked Jane, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the picnic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
coming off; and the dance at Mrs. Jacob Chandler&rsquo;s; and
no end of tea-parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For just now the neighbourhood was putting on a spurt of
gaiety, induced to it perhaps by the lovely summer sunshine.
Oliver&rsquo;s face wore a look of gloom, and he made no answer
to Jane&rsquo;s remark. Several matters, cross and contrary, were
trying Oliver Preen; not the least of them that he seemed
to make no way whatever with Miss Emma.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we left school for the midsummer holidays that
year, Mr. and Mrs. Todhetley were staying at Crabb Cot.
We got there on Friday, the eleventh of June.</p>

<p>On the following Monday morning the Squire went to his
own small sitting-room after breakfast to busy himself with
his accounts and papers. Presently I heard him call me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a mind for a walk, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I should be glad of one.&rdquo; Tod had gone to
the Whitneys for a couple of days, and without him I felt
like a fish out of water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I want you to go as far as Massock&rsquo;s. He is a
regular cheat; that man, Johnny, needs looking after&mdash;&mdash;
What is it, Thomas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For old Thomas had come in, a card between his fingers.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Gervais Preen, sir,&rdquo; he said, in answer, putting the
card on the Squire&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;Can you see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can see him; show him in. Wait a bit,
though, Thomas,&rdquo; broke off the Squire. &ldquo;Johnny, I expect
Preen has come about that pony. I suppose we may as
well keep him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod said on Saturday, sir, that we should not do better,&rdquo;
I answered. &ldquo;He tried him well, and thinks he is worth
the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay; ten pounds, wasn&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;ll keep him, then.
Mr. Preen can come in, Thomas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some few days before this the Squire had happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
say in Preen&rsquo;s hearing that he wanted a pony for the two
children to ride, Hugh and Lena. Preen caught up the
words, saying he had one for sale&mdash;a very nice pony, sound
and quiet. So the pony had been sent to Crabb Cot upon
trial, and we all liked him. His name was Taffy.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen came into the room, his small face cool and
dark as usual; he had driven from Duck Brook. &ldquo;A fine
morning,&rdquo; he remarked, as he sat down; but it would be
fiery hot by-and-by, too hot for the middle of June, and we
should probably pay for it later. The Squire asked if he
would take anything, but he declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of the pony&mdash;Taffy&mdash;Squire?&rdquo; went on Mr.
Preen. &ldquo;Do you like him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we like him very well,&rdquo; said the Squire, heartily,
&ldquo;and we mean to keep him, Preen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Preen. &ldquo;You will not repent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they fell to talking of horses in general, and of other
topics. I stayed on, sitting by the window, not having
received the message for Massock. Mr. Preen stayed also,
making no move to go away; when it suddenly occurred
to the Squire&mdash;he mentioned it later&mdash;that perhaps Preen
might be waiting for the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten pounds, I think, was the price agreed upon,&rdquo;
observed the Squire with ready carelessness. &ldquo;Would you
like to be paid now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it does not inconvenience you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire unlocked his shabby old bureau, which stood
against the wall, fingered his stock of money, and brought
forth a ten-pound bank-note. This he handed to Preen,
together with a sheet of paper, that he might give a receipt.</p>

<p>When the receipt was written, Mr. Preen took up the
note, looked at it for a moment or two, and then passed it
back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind writing your name on this note,
Squire?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The Squire laughed gently. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;but why should I? Do you think it is a bad one? No
fear, Preen; I had it from the Old Bank at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not fear that,&rdquo; said Preen, speaking quietly.
&ldquo;But since a disagreeable trouble which happened to me
some years ago, I have always liked, when receiving a bank-note,
to get, if possible, the donor&rsquo;s name upon it in his own
handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was playing cards at the house of a man of fashion,
who was brother to an earl, and lived in a fashionable square
at the West End of London, and I had a ten-pound note
paid me, for I won, by a man who, I understood, had
recently retired with honours from the army, a Major
D&mdash;&mdash;. I will not give you his name. The next day, or
next but one, I paid this note away to a tradesman, and it
was found to be forged; cleverly forged,&rdquo; repeated Preen,
with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; asked the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got Major D.&rsquo;s address from the house where we had
played, carried the note to him, and inquired what it meant
and whence he got it. Will you believe, Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo;
added the speaker, with slight agitation, &ldquo;that the man
utterly repudiated the note, saying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could he repudiate it?&rdquo; interrupted the Squire,
interested in the tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said it was not the note he had paid me; he stood
it out in the most impudent manner. I told him, and it
was the pure truth, that it was impossible there could be any
mistake. I was a poor man, down on my luck just then,
and it was the only note I had had about me for some time
past. All in vain. He held to it that it was not the note,
and there the matter ended. I could not prove that it was
the note except by my bare word. It was my word against
his, you see, and naturally I went to the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The Squire nodded. &ldquo;Who was at the loss of the
money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was. Besides that, I had the cold shoulder turned
upon me. Major D. was believed; I was doubted; some
people went so far as to say I must have trumped up the
tale. For some time after that I would not take a bank-note
from any man unless he put his signature to it, and it
has grown into a habit with me. So, if you don&rsquo;t mind,
Squire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire smiled goodnaturedly, drew the bank-note to
him, and wrote upon the back in a corner, &ldquo;J. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Preen,&rdquo; said he, returning it, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t repudiate
that. Couldn&rsquo;t if I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen put the note into his pocket-book, and rose to
leave. We strolled with him across the front garden to the
gate, where his gig was waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go as far as Norton; and possibly after that
on to Stoulton,&rdquo; he remarked, as he took the reins in his
hand and got in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have a hot drive of it,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but if one undertakes business it must be attended
to,&rdquo; said Preen, as he drove off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h2>A TRAGEDY</h2>


<h3>II.&mdash;IN THE BUTTERY</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The windows of the room, called the Buttery, which Mr.
Preen used as an office in his house at Duck Brook, were
thrown open to the warm, pure air. It was about the
hottest part of the afternoon. Oliver Preen sat back in his
chair before the large table covered with papers, waiting in
idleness and inward rebellion&mdash;rebellion against the untoward
fate which had latterly condemned him to this dreary
and monotonous life. Taking out his pocket-handkerchief
with a fling, he passed it over his fair, mild face, which was
very hot just now.</p>

<p>To-day, of all days, Oliver had wanted to be at liberty,
whereas he was being kept a prisoner longer than usual, and
for nothing. When Mr. Preen rode out after breakfast in
the morning he had left Oliver a couple of letters to copy as
a beginning, remarking that there was a great deal to do
that day, double work, and he should be back in half-an-hour.
The double work arose from the fact that none had
been done the day before, as Mr. Preen was out. For that
day, Monday&mdash;this was Tuesday&mdash;was the day Mr. Preen
had paid us a visit at Crabb Cott, to be paid for Taffy, the
pony, and had then gone to Norton, and afterwards to
Stoulton, and it had taken him the best part of the day. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the double work was waiting. But the half hours and the
hours had passed on, and Mr. Preen had not yet returned.
It was now three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and they had
dined without him.</p>

<p>Oliver, who did not dare to absent himself without permission,
and perhaps was too conscientious to do so, left
his chair for the window. The old garden was quite a
wilderness of blossom and colour, with all kinds of homely
flowers crowded into it. The young man stretched forth his
hand and plucked a spray or two of jessamine, which grew
against the wall. Idly smelling it, he lost himself in a vision
of the days gone by; his careless, happy life at Tours, in
his aunt&rsquo;s luxurious home, when he had no fear of a dark
future, had only to dress well and ride or drive out, and idly
enjoy himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was brought back to reality. The sound of
hoofs clattering into the fold-yard behind the house struck
upon his ear, and he knew his father had come home.</p>

<p>Ten minutes yet, or more, and then Mr. Preen came into
the room, his little dark face looking darker and more cross
than usual. He had been snatching some light refreshment,
and sat down at once in his place at the table, facing the
windows; Oliver sat opposite to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only copied those two letters; there was nothing
else to do,&rdquo; replied Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not have looked over the pile of letters
which came this morning, to see whether there were any
you could answer?&rdquo; growled Mr. Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, father,&rdquo; replied Oliver in slight surprise; &ldquo;I
did not know I might look at them. And if I had looked I
should not have known what to reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen began reading the letters over at railroad
speed, dictating answers for Oliver to write, writing some
himself. This took time. He had been unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
detained at the other end of Captain Falkner&rsquo;s land by some
business which had vexed him. Most of these letters were
from farmers and others, about the new patent agricultural
implements for which Mr. Preen had taken the agency. He
wished to push the sale of them, as it gave him a good
percentage.</p>

<p>The answers, addressed and stamped for the post, at
length lay ready on the table. Mr. Preen then took out
his pocket-book and extracted from it that ten-pound bank-note
given him the previous morning by Mr. Todhetley for
the children&rsquo;s pony, the note he had got the Squire to
indorse, as I have already told. Letting the bank-note lie
open before him, Mr. Preen penned a few lines, as follows,
Oliver looking on:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I enclose you the ten pounds. Have not
been able to send it before. Truly yours, <span class="sign2">G. Preen.&rdquo;</span><br /></p>

<p class="cl">Mr. Preen folded the sheet on which he had written this,
put the bank-note within it, and enclosed all in a good-sized
business envelope, which he fastened securely down. He
then addressed it to John Paul, Esquire, Islip, and put on
a postage stamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall seal this, Oliver,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s safer. Get
the candle and the wax. Here, you can seal it,&rdquo; he added,
taking the signet ring from his finger, on which was engraved
the crest of the Preen family.</p>

<p>Oliver lighted a candle kept on a stand at the back for
such purposes, brought it to the table, and sealed the letter
with a large, imposing red seal. As he passed the ring and
letter back to his father, he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are particularly anxious that the letter should
reach Mr. Paul safely, father, and of course you are so, as
it contains money, why did you not send it by hand? I
would have taken it to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing safer than the post,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Preen, &ldquo;and I want him to have it to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver laughed. &ldquo;I could have taken it this evening,
father. I can do so still, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it shall go by post. You want to be off to MacEveril,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; replied Oliver. &ldquo;Had I been able to
finish here this morning I might have gone over this afternoon;
it is too late now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had nothing to do all day yesterday,&rdquo; growled
his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know. I am not grumbling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen put the letter into his pocket, gathered up the
pile of other letters, handed half of them to his son, for it
was a pretty good heap, and they started for the post, about
three minutes&rsquo; walk.</p>

<p>The small shop containing the post-office at Duck Brook
was kept by Mrs. Sym, who sold sweetstuff, also tapes and
cottons. Young Sym, her son, a growing youth, delivered
the letters, which were brought in by a mail-cart. She was
a clean, tidy woman of middle age, never seen out of a
muslin cap with a wide border and a black bow, a handkerchief
crossed over her shoulders, and a checked apron.</p>

<p>Oliver, of lighter step than his father, reached the post-office
first and tumbled his portion of the letters into the
box placed in the window to receive them. The next
moment Mr. Preen put his in also, together with the letter
addressed to Mr. Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are too late,&rdquo; observed Oliver. &ldquo;I thought we
should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Preen, in surprise, as he turned
round. &ldquo;Too late! Why how can the afternoon have
gone on?&rdquo; he continued, his eyes falling on the clock of the
little grey church which stood beyond the triangle of houses,
the hands of which were pointing to a quarter past five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you knew it was so late why did you not say so?&rdquo;
he asked sharply of his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not sure until I saw the clock; I only thought it
must be late by the time we had been at work,&rdquo; replied
Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have sent you over with that letter as you
suggested, had I known it would not go to-night. I wonder
whether Dame Sym would give it back to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dived down the two steps into the shop as he spoke,
Oliver following. Dame Sym&mdash;so Duck Brook called her&mdash;stood
knitting behind the little counter, an employment she
took up at spare moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sym, I&rsquo;ve just put some letters into the box, not
perceiving that it was past five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; began Mr. Preen,
civilly. &ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ll not go to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; replied the humble post-mistress. &ldquo;The
bag&rsquo;s made up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one letter that will hardly bear delay. It is for
Mr. Paul of Islip. If you can return it me out of the box
I will send it over by hand at once; my son will take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is not possible, sir. Once a letter is put into the
box I dare not give it back again,&rdquo; remonstrated Mrs.
Sym, gazing amiably at Mr. Preen through her spectacles,
whose round glasses had a trick of glistening when at right
angles with the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might stretch a point for once, to oblige me,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Preen, fretfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d not need to be pressed to do it, sir, if
I could,&rdquo; she cried in her hearty way. &ldquo;But I dare not
break the rules, sir; I might lose my place. Our orders
are not to open the receiving box until the time for making-up,
or give a letter back on any pretence whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen saw that further argument would be useless.
She was a kindly, obliging old body, but upright to the last
degree in all that related to her place. Anything that she
believed (right or wrong) might not be done she stuck to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obstinate as the grave,&rdquo; muttered he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Dame Sym did not hear; she had turned away to serve
a child who came in for some toffee. Mr. Preen waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will the letter go?&rdquo; he asked, as the child went
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By to-morrow&rsquo;s day mail, sir. It will be delivered at
Islip&mdash;I think you said Islip, Mr. Preen&mdash;about half-past
four, or so, in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the delay of much consequence, sir?&rdquo; inquired
Oliver, as he and his father turned out of the shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Preen. &ldquo;Only I hate letters to be
delayed uselessly in the post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tea was waiting when they got in. A mutton chop was
served with it for Mr. Preen, as he had lost his dinner.
Jane ran downstairs, drank a cup of tea in haste, and ran
back again. She had been busy in her bedroom all day,
smartening-up a dress. A picnic was to be held on Thursday,
the next day but one; Jane and Oliver were invited
to it, and Jane wanted to look as well as other girls.</p>

<p>After tea Oliver sat for ever so long at the open window,
reading the <cite>Worcester Journal</cite>. He then strolled out to
the Inlets, sauntered beside the brook, and presently threw
himself listlessly upon one of the benches facing it. The
sun shone right upon his face there, so he tilted his straw
hat over his eyes. That did not do, and he moved to
another bench which the trees shaded. He often felt lonely
and weary now; this evening especially so; even Jane was
not with him.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to Emma Paul; and a glow, bright
as the declining sun rays, shot up in his heart. As long as
<em>she</em> filled it, he could not be all gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had means to justify it I should speak to her,&rdquo;
mused he&mdash;as he had told himself forty times over, and
forty more. &ldquo;But when a fellow has no fortune, and no
prospect of fortune; when it may be seen by no end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
odd signs and tokens that he has not so much as a silver
coin in his pocket, how can he ask a girl the one great
question of life? Old Paul would send me to the right-about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned his head sideways for a few minutes against
the trunk of a tree, gazing at the reddening sky through
the green tracery of the waving boughs; and fell to musing
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she loved me as I love her, she would be glad to
wait on as things are, hoping for better times. Lovers,
who are truly attached to each other, do wait for years and
years, and are all the happier for it. Sometimes I feel
inclined to enlist in a crack regiment. The worst of it is
that a fellow rarely rises from the ranks in England to
position and honour, as he does in France; they manage
things better over there. If old Uncle Edward would
only open his purse-strings and buy me a commission, I
might&mdash;&mdash; Halloa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A burst of girlish laughter, and a pair of girlish arms,
flung round his neck from behind, disturbed Oliver&rsquo;s
castles-in-the-air. Jane came round and sat down beside
him. &ldquo;I thought I should find you here, Oliver,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frock finished, Janey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finished! why no,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It will hardly be
finished by this time to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how idle you must have been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idle? You don&rsquo;t understand things, or the time it
takes to make an old frock into a new one. A dressmaker
might have done it in a day, but I&rsquo;m not a dressmaker, you
know, Oliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a silk gown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a mousseline-de-laine, if you chance to be acquainted
with that material,&rdquo; answered Janey. &ldquo;It was very
pretty when it was new: pale pink and lilac blossoms upon
a cream ground. But it has been washed, and that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
made it shrink, and it has to be let out everywhere and
lengthened, and the faded silk trimming has to be turned,
and&mdash;oh, ever so much work. And now, I daresay you are
as wise as you were before, Oliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of washed-out dresses,&rdquo; remarked Oliver.
&ldquo;They look like rags, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some may. Mine won&rsquo;t. It has washed like a pocket-handkerchief,
and it looks as good as new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish my coats would wash,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;They are
getting shabby, and I want some new ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not having any consolation to administer in regard to the
coats, Jane did not take up the subject. &ldquo;What have you
been doing all day, Oliver?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Airing my patience in that blessed Buttery,&rdquo; replied he.
&ldquo;Never stirred out of it at all, except for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you wanted to get over to Islip this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might want to get over to the North Pole, and be none
the nearer to it. MacEveril was bound for some place a
mile or two across fields this afternoon, on business for
the office, and I promised to go over to walk with him.
Promises, though, are like pie-crust, Janey: made to be
broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane nodded assent. &ldquo;And a promise which you are
obliged to break is sure to be one you particularly want to
keep. I wish I had a pair of new gloves, Oliver. Pale
grey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had half-a-dozen new pairs, for the matter of
that. Just look at those little minnows, leaping in the
water. How pretty they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the edge of the brook and stood looking down
at the small fry. Jane followed. Then they walked about
in the Inlets, then sat down again and watched the sunset;
and so the evening wore away until they went home.</p>

<p>Jane was shut up again the following day, busy with her
dress; Oliver, as usual, was in the Buttery with his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
At twelve o&rsquo;clock Mr. Preen prepared to go out to keep an
appointment at Evesham, leaving Oliver a lot of work to do,
very much to his aggravation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame. It will take me all the afternoon to get
through it,&rdquo; ran his thoughts&mdash;and he would have liked to
say so aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look pleased, young man,&rdquo; remarked his
father. &ldquo;Recollect you will be off duty to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver&rsquo;s countenance cleared; his disposition was a
pleasant one, never retaining anger long, and he set to his
task with a good will. The morrow being the day of the
picnic, he would have whole holiday.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock the young servant carried the tea-tray into
the parlour. Presently Mrs. Preen came in, made the tea,
and sat down to wait for her son and daughter. Tired and
hot, she was glad of the rest.</p>

<p>Jane ran downstairs, all happiness. &ldquo;Mamma, it is
finished,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;quite finished. It looks so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had need look well,&rdquo; fretfully retorted Mrs. Preen,
who had been unable to get at Jane for any useful purpose
these two days, and resented it accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When all trades fail I can turn dressmaker,&rdquo; said the
girl, gaily. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Buttery, I expect; he said he had a great deal
to do there this afternoon, and I have not seen him about,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Preen, as she poured out the tea. &ldquo;Not that
I should have been likely to see him&mdash;shut into that hot
kitchen with the ironing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane knew this was a shaft meant for herself. At ordinary
times she did her share of the ironing. &ldquo;I will tell Oliver
that tea is ready, mamma,&rdquo; she said, rising to go to the
other room. &ldquo;Why, there he is, sitting in the shade under
the walnut tree,&rdquo; she exclaimed, happening to look from the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sitting out in the cool,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Preen. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t blame him, poring all day long over those accounts
and things. Call him in, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; said Oliver, in response to Jane&rsquo;s call from
the open window.</p>

<p>He crossed the grass slowly, fanning himself with his
straw hat. His fair face&mdash;an unusual thing with him&mdash;was
scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look red-hot, Oliver,&rdquo; laughed his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is as hot to-morrow as it is to-day we shall get a
baking,&rdquo; returned Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this intense weather nothing makes one feel the heat
like work, and I suppose you&rsquo;ve been hard at it this afternoon,&rdquo;
said his mother in a tone of compassion, for she
disliked work naturally very much herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course; I had to be,&rdquo; answered Oliver.</p>

<p>He and Jane sat together under the shade of the walnut
tree after tea. When it grew a little cooler they went to the
Inlets, that favourite resort of theirs; a spot destined to
bear a strange significance for one of them in the days to
come; a haunting remembrance.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The white mist, giving promise of a hot and glorious day,
had hardly cleared itself from the earth, when, at ten o&rsquo;clock
on the Thursday morning, Jane and Oliver Preen set off in
the gig for North Villa, both of them as spruce as you
please; Jane in that pretty summer dress she had spent so
much work over, a straw hat with its wreath of pink may
shading her fair face, Oliver with a white rose in his button-hole.
The party was first to assemble at Mrs. Jacob
Chandler&rsquo;s, and to go from thence in waggonettes. There
had been some trouble about the gig, Mr. Preen wanting it
himself that day, or telling Jane and Oliver that he did, and
that they could walk. Jane almost cried, declaring she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
not care to arrive at North Villa looking like a milkmaid,
hot and red with walking; and Mr. Preen gave way.
Oliver was to drive himself and Jane, Sam being sent on to
Crabb to bring back the gig.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen did not regard the picnic with favour. Mr.
Preen could not imagine what anybody could want at one,
he said, when ungraciously giving consent to Oliver&rsquo;s absenting
himself from that delightful Buttery for a whole day.</p>

<p>Picnics in truth are nearly all alike, and are no doubt
more agreeable to the young than to the old. This one was
given conjointly by the Jacob Chandlers, the Letsoms, the
Coneys, and the Ashtons of Timberdale. A few honorary
guests were invited. I call them honorary because they
had nothing to do with finding provisions. Tod got an
invitation, myself also; and uncommonly vexed we were
not to be able to arrive till late in the afternoon. The
Beeles from Pigeon Green were coming to spend the day at
Crabb Cot, and the Squire would not let us off earlier.</p>

<p>The picnic was held upon Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s farm, not far
from Crabb, and a charming spot for it. Gentle hills and
dales, shady groves and mossy glens surrounded the house,
which was a very good one. So that it may be said we all
were chiefly Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s guests. Mrs. Cramp made a
beaming hostess, and was commander-in-chief at her own
tea-table. Tea was taken in her large parlour, to save the
bother of carrying things out. Dinner had been taken in
the dell, under shade of the high and wide-spreading trees.</p>

<p>They were seated at tea when we got there. Such a
large company at the long table; and such tempting things
to eat! I found a seat by Emma Paul, the prettiest girl
there; Oliver Preen was next her on the other side. Mary
MacEveril made room for Tod beside her. The MacEverils
were proud, exclusive people, and Miss MacEveril privately
looked down on some of her fellow guests; but Tod was
welcome; he was of her own order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Two or three minutes later Tom Chandler came in; he
also had not been able to get away earlier. He shook
hands with his aunt, Mrs. Cramp, nodded to the rest of us,
and deftly managed to wedge himself in between Emma
Paul and young Preen. Preen did not seem pleased, Emma
did; and made all the room she could, by crushing me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your shoes to-morrow morning, young
man,&rdquo; began Mr. Chandler, in a serio-comic tone, as he
looked at Dick MacEveril across the table. &ldquo;To leave the
office to its own devices the first thing this morning, in
defiance of orders&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang the musty old office!&rdquo; interrupted MacEveril,
with a genial laugh.</p>

<p>Valentine Chandler had done the same by his office;
pleasure first and business later always with both of them;
but Valentine was his own master and MacEveril was not.
In point of fact, Mr. Paul, not a man to be set at defiance
by his clerks, was in a great rage with Dick MacEveril.</p>

<p>I supposed the attractions of the picnic had been too
powerful for Dick, and that he thought the sooner he got to
it the better. But this proved to be a fallacy. Mrs. Cramp
was setting her nephew right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Tom, you are mistaken. Mr. MacEveril did
not come this morning; he only got here an hour ago&mdash;like
two or three more of the young men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he not, Aunt Mary Ann?&rdquo; replied Tom, turning
his handsome, pleasant face upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if you were not at the office I should like to
know what you did with yourself all day, Dick,&rdquo; severely
cried Miss MacEveril, bending forward to regard her
cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to see the pigeon-match,&rdquo; said Dick, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see the pigeon-match!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;How cruel
of you! You had better not let papa know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anyone lets him know it will be yourself, Miss Mary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
And suppose you hold your tongue now,&rdquo; cried Dick, not
very politely.</p>

<p>This little passage-at-arms over, we went on with tea.
Afterwards we strolled out of doors and disposed of ourselves
at will. Some of the Chandler girls took possession
of me, and I went about with them.</p>

<p>When it was getting late, and they had talked me deaf, I
began looking about for Tod, and found him on a bench
within the Grove. A sheltered spot. Sitting there, you
could look out, but people could not look in. Mary MacEveril
and Georgiana Chandler were with him; Oliver
Preen stood close by, leaning against the stump of a tree.
I thought how sad his look was, and wondered what made
it so.</p>

<p>Within view of us, but not within hearing, in a dark,
narrow walk Tom Chandler and Emma Paul were pacing
side by side, absorbed evidently in one another. The sun
had set, the lovely colours in the sky were giving place to
twilight. It was the hour when matter-of-fact prosaic
influences change into romance; when, if there&rsquo;s any
sentiment within us it is safe to come out.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;It is the hour when from the boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nightingale&rsquo;s high note is heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the hour when lovers&rsquo; vows<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seem sweet in every whispered word,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as Lord Byron says. And who could discourse on love&mdash;the
true ring of it, mind you&mdash;as he did?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do sing,&rdquo; said Tod to Miss MacEveril; and I found
they had been teasing her to do so for the last five minutes.
She had a pleasant voice and sang well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t care to hear me, Mr. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure I do,&rdquo; answered Tod, who would flirt with
pretty girls when the fit took him. Flirt and flatter too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have everyone coming round us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul of them. They are all away somewhere, out
of hearing. Do sing me one song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began at once, without more ado, choosing an old
song that Mrs. Todhetley often chose; one that was a
favourite of hers, as it was of mine: &ldquo;Faithless Emma.&rdquo;
Those songs of the old days bore, all of them, a history.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;I wandered once at break of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet upon the sunless sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wanton sighs the breeze delayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o&rsquo;er the wavy surface played.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first the fairest face I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First loved the eye of softest blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ventured, fearful, first to sip<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Of faithless Emma.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So mixed the rose and lily white<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I wish I ne&rsquo;er had seen her eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne&rsquo;er seen her cheeks of doubtful dye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever, ever dared to sip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweets that hung upon the lip<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of faithless Emma.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now though from early dawn of day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sweets that hung upon the lip<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of faithless Emma.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;I think all Emmas are faithless,&rdquo; exclaimed Georgiana,
speaking at random, as the last sounds of the sweet song
died away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sweeping assertion, Miss Georgie,&rdquo; laughed Tod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way, I knew two girls named Emma who were
faithless to their engaged lovers, and one of them&rsquo;s not
married yet to any one else,&rdquo; returned Georgie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know one Emma who will be true for ever and
a day,&rdquo; cried Tod, as he pointed significantly to Emma
Paul, still walking side by side with Tom Chandler in the
distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have told you that before now,&rdquo; said Mary
MacEveril. &ldquo;I have seen it for a long time, though Miss
Emma will never confess to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, I fancy it will soon be a case,&rdquo; continued
Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A case!&rdquo; cried Georgie. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular case; dead, and gone, and done for,&rdquo; nodded
Tod. &ldquo;Church bells and wedding gloves, and all the rest
of the paraphernalia. Looks like it, anyhow, to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Georgie, &ldquo;then how sly Tom has been
over it, never to tell us! Is it really true? I shall ask
Valentine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last person likely to know,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
find it&rsquo;s true enough, Georgie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Georgie began, and broke off. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;They are beginning to dance on the lawn.
Come, Mary.&rdquo; And the two girls moved away, attracted by
the scraping of the fiddle.</p>

<p>Oliver Preen moved a step forward from the tree, speaking
in a low, calm tone; but his face was white as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you alluding to <em>them</em>?&rdquo; he asked, looking across
to those two pacing about. &ldquo;Why do you say it is a
&lsquo;case&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am sure it is one,&rdquo; answered Tod. &ldquo;They
have been in love with one another this many a day past,
those two, months and months and years. As everyone
might see who had eyes, except old Paul. That&rsquo;s why,
Preen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver did not answer. He had his arm round the trunk
of a tree looking across as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t stake a fortune that Paul has not seen
it also,&rdquo; went on Tod. &ldquo;All the same, I had a rumour
whispered to me to-day that he sees it now, and has said,
&lsquo;Bless you, my children.&rsquo; Tom Chandler is to be made his
partner and to marry Emma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are too many girls there, and want you for
partners,&rdquo; cried Eliza Letsom, dashing up. &ldquo;Do come and
dance with us, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What else could I do? Or Tod, either.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock when the party separated.
The waggonettes held us all, and nice scrambling and crowding
we had for seats. One of the vehicles, after setting
down some of its freight&mdash;ourselves and the Miss Chandlers&mdash;continued
its way to Duck Brook with Jane and Oliver
Preen.</p>

<p>It was a lovely night. The moon had risen, and was
flooding the earth with its soft light. Jane sat looking at it
in romantic reverie. Suddenly it struck her that her brother
was unusually still; he had not spoken a single word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How silent you are, Oliver. You are not asleep, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver slowly raised his bent head. &ldquo;Silent?&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t talk much after a tiring day such as
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it must be getting on for twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said
Jane. &ldquo;What a delightfully happy day it has been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one bad day of all my life,&rdquo; groaned Oliver, in
spirit. But he broke into the two lines, in pretended gaiety,
that some one had sung on the box-seat of the waggonette
when leaving Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;For the best of all ways to lengthen our days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to steal a few hours from the night, my dear.&rdquo;<br /></span>

</div></div></div>


<h4>III</h4>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Robert Derrick is getting troublesome.
He has been here three times in as many days, pressing for
ten pounds, the instalment of your debt now due to him.
Will you be good enough to transmit it to me, that I may
pay and get rid of him.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign3">&ldquo;Truly yours,</span>    <span class="sign1">John Paul.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter, written by Lawyer Paul of Islip, came to Mr.
Preen by the Thursday morning post, just a week after the
picnic. It put him into a temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do Paul&rsquo;s people mean by their carelessness?&rdquo; he
exclaimed angrily, as he snatched a sheet of paper to pen
the answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Paul</span>,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. I
sent the money to you ten days ago&mdash;a bank-note, enclosed
in a letter to yourself.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign3">&ldquo;Truly yours,</span>    <span class="sign1">G. Preen.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Calling Oliver from his breakfast, Mr. Preen despatched
this answer by him at once to the post-office. There was
no hurry whatever, since the day mail had gone out, and it
would lie in Mrs. Sym&rsquo;s drawer until towards evening, but
an angry man knows nothing of patience.</p>

<p>The week since the picnic had not been productive of
any particular event, except a little doubt and trouble
regarding Dick MacEveril. Mr. Paul was so much annoyed,
at Dick&rsquo;s taking French leave to absent himself from the
office that day, that he attacked him with hot words when
he entered it on the Friday morning. Dick took it very
coolly&mdash;old Paul said &ldquo;insolently,&rdquo; and retorted that he
wanted a longer holiday than that, a whole fortnight, and
that he must have it. Shortly and sharply Mr. Paul told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
him he could not have it, unless he chose to have it for
good.</p>

<p>Dick took him at his word. Catching up his hat and
stick, he went out of the office there and then, and had not
since appeared at it. Not only that: during the Friday he
disappeared also from Islip. Nobody knew for certain
whither he had gone, or where he was: unless it might be
London. He had made no secret of what he wanted a
holiday for. Some young fellow whom he had known in
Australia had recently landed at the docks and was in
London, and Dick wanted to go up to see him.</p>

<p>Deprived of his friend, and deprived of his heart&rsquo;s love,
Oliver Preen was in a bad case. The news of Emma Paul&rsquo;s
engagement to Thomas Chandler, and the news that
Chandler was to have a share in her father&rsquo;s business, had
been made public; the speedy marriage was already talked
of. No living person saw what havoc it was making of
Oliver Preen. Jane found him unnaturally quiet. He would
sit by the hour together and never say a word to her or to
anyone else, apparently plunged in what might be either
profound scientific calculations or grim despondency. It
was as if he had the care of the world upon his mind, and
at times there would break from him a sudden long-drawn
sigh. Poor Oliver! Earth&rsquo;s sunshine had gone out for him
with sweet Emma Paul.</p>

<p>She had not been faithless, like the Faithless Emma of
the song, for she had never cared for anyone but Tom
Chandler, had never given the smallest encouragement to
another. Oliver had only deluded himself. To his heart,
filled and blinded with its impassioned love, her open,
pleasing manners had seemed to be a response, and so he
had mistaken her. That was all.</p>

<p>But this is sentiment, which the world, having grown
enlightened of late years, practically despises; and we must
go on to something more sensible and serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer sent by Mr. Preen to John Paul of Islip
brought forth an answer in its turn. It was to the effect
that Mr. Paul had not seen anything of the letter spoken of
by Mr. Preen, or of the money it was said to contain.</p>

<p>This reached Duck Brook on the Saturday morning. Mr.
Preen, more puzzled this time than angry, could not make
it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which day was it last week that I
wrote that letter to Paul of Islip, enclosing a ten-pound
note?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; carelessly replied Oliver. They had
not yet settled to work, and Oliver was stretched out at the
open window, talking to a little dog that was leaping up
outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not remember!&rdquo; indignantly echoed Mr. Preen. &ldquo;My
memory is distracted with a host of cares, but yours has
nothing to trouble it. Bring your head in, sir, and attend
to me properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver dutifully brought his head in, his face red with
stooping. &ldquo;What was it you asked me, father? I did not
quite catch it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked you if you could remember which day I sent
that money to Paul. But I think I remember now for
myself. It was the day after I received the bank-note from
Mr. Todhetley. That was Monday. Then I sent the letter
to Paul with the bank-note in it on the Tuesday. You
sealed it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember quite well that it was Tuesday&mdash;two days
before the picnic,&rdquo; said Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course; a picnic is a matter to remember anything
by,&rdquo; returned Mr. Preen, sarcastically. &ldquo;Well, Paul
says he has never received either money or letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The letter was posted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Oliver, but his father
impatiently interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it was posted. You saw me post it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was too late for the evening&rsquo;s post; Dame Sym said
it would go out the next morning,&rdquo; went on Oliver. &ldquo;Are
Paul&rsquo;s people sure they did not receive it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul tells me so. Paul is an exact man, and would
not tolerate any but exact clerks about him. He writes
positively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Mrs. Sym did not forget to forward it?&rdquo;
suggested Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idiot you are!&rdquo; retorted his father, by way of
being complimentary. &ldquo;The letter must have gone out
safely enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after Mr. Preen had attended to his other
letters and to two or three matters they involved, he put on
his hat and went to Mrs. Sym&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The debt for which the money was owing appeared to be
a somewhat mysterious one. Robert Derrick, a man who
dealt in horses, or in anything else by which he could make
money, and attended all fairs near and far, lived about two
miles from Islip. One day, about a year back, Derrick
presented himself at the office of Mr. Paul, and asked that
gentleman if he would sue Gervais Preen for a sum of
money, forty pounds, which had been long owing to him.
What was it owing for, Mr. Paul inquired; but Derrick
declined to say. Instead of suing him, the lawyer wrote to
request Mr. Preen to call upon him, which Mr. Preen did.
He acknowledged that he did owe the debt&mdash;forty pounds&mdash;but,
like Derrick, he evaded the question when asked what
he owed it for. Perhaps it was for a horse, or horses,
suggested Mr. Paul. No, it was for nothing of that kind,
Mr. Preen replied; it was a strictly private debt.</p>

<p>An arrangement was come to. To pay the whole at once
was not, Mr. Preen said, in his power; but he would pay it
by instalments. Ten pounds every six months he would
place in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s hands, to be handed to Derrick, whom
Mr. Preen refused to see. This arrangement Derrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
agreed to. Two instalments had already been paid, and
one which seemed to have now miscarried in the post was
the third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sym,&rdquo; began Mr. Preen, when he had dived into
the sweet-stuff shop, and confronted the post-mistress behind
her counter, &ldquo;do you recollect, one day last week, my
asking you to give me back a letter which I had just posted,
addressed to Mr. Paul of Islip, and you refused?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I do,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sym. &ldquo;I was sorry,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. What I want to ask you is this: did
you notice that letter when you made up the bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, sir. I noticed it particularly in consequence of
what had passed. It was sealed with a large red seal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. Well, Mr. Paul declares that letter has not
reached him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it must have reached him,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Sym,
fastening her glittering spectacles upon the speaker&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;It had Mr. Paul&rsquo;s address upon it in plain writing, and
it went away from here in the bag with the rest of the
letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The letter had a ten-pound note in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sym paused. &ldquo;Well, sir, if so, that would not
endanger the letter&rsquo;s safety. Who was to know it had?
But letters that contain money ought to be registered, Mr.
Preen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure it went away as usual from here&mdash;all
safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure and certain, sir. And I think it must have reached
Mr. Paul, if I may say so. He may have overlooked it;
perhaps let it fall into some part of his desk, unopened.
Why, some years ago, there was a great fuss made about a
letter which was sent to Captain Falkner, when he was
living at the Hall. He came here one day, complaining to
me that a letter sent to him by post, which had money in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
it, had never been delivered. The trouble there was over
that lost letter, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you. The Captain
accused the post-office in London, for it was London it
came from, of never having forwarded it; then he accused
me of not sending it out with the delivery. After all, it
was himself who had mislaid the letter. He had somehow
let it fall unnoticed into a deep drawer of his writing-table
when it was handed to him with other letters at the
morning&rsquo;s delivery; and there it lay all snug till found, hid
away amid a mass of papers. What do you think of that,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen did not say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In all the years I have kept this post-office I can&rsquo;t call
to memory one single letter being lost in the transit,&rdquo; she
ran on, warming in her own cause. &ldquo;Why, how could it,
sir? Once a letter&rsquo;s sent away safe in the bag, there it
must be; it can&rsquo;t fall out of it. Your letter was so sent
away by me, Mr. Preen, and where should it be if Mr. Paul
hasn&rsquo;t got it? Please tell him, sir, from me, that I&rsquo;d
respectfully suggest he should look well about his desk and
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently it was not at this side the letter had been lost&mdash;if
lost it was. Mr. Preen wished the post-mistress good
morning, and walked away. Her suggestion had impressed
him; he began to think it very likely indeed that Paul had
overlooked the letter on its arrival, and would find it about
his desk, or table, or some other receptacle for papers.</p>

<p>He drove over to Islip in the gig in the afternoon, taking
Oliver with him. Islip reached, he left Oliver in the gig, to
wait at the door or drive slowly about as he pleased, while
he went into the office to, as he expressed it, &ldquo;have it
out with Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not at once, however, could he do that, for Mr. Paul was
out; but he saw Tom Chandler.</p>

<p>The offices, situated in the heart of Islip, and not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
stone&rsquo;s throw from the offices of Valentine Chandler, consisted
of three rooms, all on the ground floor. The clerks&rsquo;
room was in front, its windows (painted white, so that no
one could see in or out) faced the street; Mr. Paul&rsquo;s room
lay behind it and looked on to a garden. There was also
a small slip of a room, not much better than a passage, into
which Mr. Paul could take clients whose business was very
private indeed. Tom Chandler, about to be made a partner,
had a desk in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s room as well as one in the clerks&rsquo;
room. It was at the latter that he usually sat.</p>

<p>On this afternoon he was seated at his desk in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s
room when Gervais Preen entered. Tom received him
with a smile and a hand-shake, and gave him a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come about that letter, Mr. Chandler,&rdquo; began the
visitor; &ldquo;my letter with the ten-pound bank-note in it,
which Mr. Paul denies having received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you no such letter was received by us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was addressed in a plain handwriting to Mr. Paul
himself, and protected by a seal of red wax with my crest
upon it,&rdquo; irritably interrupted the applicant, who hated to
be contradicted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Preen, you may believe me when I tell you the
letter never reached us,&rdquo; said Tom, a smile crossing his
candid, handsome face, at the other&rsquo;s irritability.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where is the letter? What became of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say perhaps it was never posted,&rdquo; mildly
suggested Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not posted!&rdquo; tartly echoed Mr. Preen. &ldquo;Why, I
posted it myself; as Dame Sym, over at Duck Brook, can
testify. And my son also, for that matter; he stood by
and saw me put it into the box. Dame Sym sent it away
in the bag with the rest; she remembers the letter
perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never was delivered to us,&rdquo; said Tom, shaking his
head. &ldquo;If&mdash;&mdash; oh, here is Mr. Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The portly lawyer came into the room, pushing back his
iron-grey hair. He sat down at his own desk-table; Mr.
Preen drew his chair so as to face him, and the affair was
thoroughly gone into. It cannot be denied that the experienced
man of law, knowing how difficult it was to Mr.
Preen to find money for his debts and his needs, had
allowed some faint doubt to float within him in regard to
this reported loss. Was it a true loss?&mdash;or an invented
one? But old Paul read people&rsquo;s characters, as betrayed
in their tones and faces, tolerably well; he saw that Preen
was in desperate earnest, and he began to believe his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You posted it on Tuesday,
the fifteenth. You found it was too late for that night&rsquo;s
post, and would not go off until the morrow morning, when,
as Dame Sym says, she despatched it. Then we ought to
have received it that afternoon&mdash;Wednesday, the sixteenth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Mr. Preen. &ldquo;Mrs. Sym wished to
respectfully suggest to you, Paul, that you might have overlooked
it amidst the other letters at the time it was delivered,
and let it drop unseen into some drawer or desk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she did, did she?&rdquo; cried old Paul, while Tom
Chandler laughed. &ldquo;Give my respects to her, Preen, and
tell her I&rsquo;m not an old woman. We don&rsquo;t get many letters
in an afternoon, sometimes not any,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Can
you carry your memory back to that Wednesday afternoon,
Chandler?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay I shall be able to do so,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;Wednesday, the sixteenth.&mdash;Was not that the day before
the picnic at Aunt Cramp&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth has the picnic to do with it?&rdquo; sharply
demanded Mr. Preen. &ldquo;All you young men are alike.
Oliver could only remember the date of my posting the letter
by recalling that of the picnic. You should be above such
frivolity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Chandler laughed. &ldquo;I remember the day before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the picnic for a special reason, sir. MacEveril asked for
holiday that he might go to it. I told him he could not
have the whole day, we were too busy, but perhaps he might
get half of it; upon which he said half a day was no good
to him, and gave me some sauce. Yes, that was Wednesday,
the sixteenth; and now, having that landmark to go
by, I may be able to trace back other events and the
number of letters which came in that afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is MacEveril back yet?&rdquo; asked Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;The captain does not know where
he is; no one does know, that I&rsquo;m aware of. Look here,
Preen; as this letter appears to be really lost, and very
unaccountably, since Mrs. Sym is sure she sent it off, and I
am sure it was never delivered to me, I shall go to our
office here now, and inquire about it. Will you come
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen was only too glad to go to any earthly place
that was likely to afford news of his ten-pound note, for the
loss would be his, and he knew not where he should find
another ten pounds to satisfy the insatiable Derrick.</p>

<p>They proceeded along the pavement together, passing
Oliver, who was slowly parading the gig up and down the
street. His sad face&mdash;unusually sad it looked&mdash;had a sort
of expectancy on it as he turned his gaze from side to side,
lest by some happy chance it might catch the form of
Emma Paul. Emma might be going to marry another; but,
all the same, Oliver could not drop her out of his heart.</p>

<p>They disclaimed all recollection of the letter at the post-office.
Had it been for a private individual it might have
been remembered, but Mr. Paul had too many letters to
allow of that, unless something special called attention to
any one of them. Whether the letter in question had
reached them by the Islip bag, or whether it had not, they
could not say; but they could positively affirm that, if it
had, it had been sent out to Mr. Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>In returning they overtook the postman on his round,
with the afternoon delivery: a young, active man, who
seemed to skim over the ground, and was honest as the
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dale,&rdquo; said Lawyer Paul, &ldquo;there has been a letter lost,
addressed to me. I wonder whether you chanced to notice
such a letter?&rdquo; And he mentioned the details of the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day is like another to me in its round of duties,
you see, sir,&rdquo; observed the man. &ldquo;Sealed with a big red
seal, you say, sir? Well, it might be, but that&rsquo;s nothing for
me to go by; so many of your letters are sealed, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer returned to his office with Mr. Preen, and
entered his own room. Tom Chandler heard them and
came swiftly through the door which opened from the
clerks&rsquo; department, a smile of satisfaction on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember all about the letters that were brought in
on Wednesday week,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I can recall the whole of
the circumstances; they were rather unusual.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>


<h2>A TRAGEDY</h2>


<h3>III.&mdash;MYSTERY</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Thomas Chandler possessed a clear, retentive memory by
nature, and he had done nothing to cloud it. After his
master, Lawyer Paul&mdash;soon to be no longer his master, but
his partner&mdash;had gone out with Mr. Preen to make inquiries
at the post-office for the missing letter, he sat down to bring
his memory into exercise.</p>

<p>Carrying his thoughts back to the Wednesday afternoon,
some ten days ago, when the letter ought to have been
delivered at Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office, and was not&mdash;at least, so far
as could be traced at present&mdash;he had little difficulty in
recalling its chief events, one remembered incident leading
up to another.</p>

<p>Then he passed into the front room, and spoke for some
minutes with Michael Hanborough, a steady little man of
middle age, who had been with Mr. Paul over twenty years.
There was one clerk under him, Tite Batley (full name
Titus), and there had been young Richard MacEveril. The
disappearance of the latter had caused the office to be busy
just now, Michael Hanborough especially so. He was in
the room alone when Mr. Chandler entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not gone to tea yet, Mr. Hanborough!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I wanted to finish this deed, first. Batley&rsquo;s
gone to his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Hanborough, I want to ask you a question
or two. That deed&rsquo;s in no particular hurry, for I am sure
Mr. Paul will not be ready to send it off to-day,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Chandler. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a fuss over that letter
of Preen&rsquo;s, which appears to have been unaccountably lost.
I have been carrying my thoughts back to the Wednesday
afternoon when it ought to have been delivered here, and I
want you to do the same. Try and recollect anything and
everything you can, connected with that afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Chandler, the letter could not have been
delivered here; Mr. Paul says so,&rdquo; reasoned Michael
Hanborough, turning from his desk while he spoke and
leaning his elbow upon it.</p>

<p>His desk stood between the window and the door which
opened from the passage; the window being at his right
hand as he sat. Opposite, beside the other window, was
Mr. Chandler&rsquo;s desk. A larger desk, used by MacEveril
and young Batley, crossed the lower end of the room, facing
the window; and near it was the narrow door that opened
to Mr. Paul&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>Thomas Chandler remained talking with Hanborough
until he saw the lawyer and Mr. Preen return, when he
joined them in the other room. They mentioned their
failure at the post-office, and he then related to them what
he had been able to recall.</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon, the sixteenth of June, had been
distinguished in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office by a little breeze raised by
Richard MacEveril. Suddenly looking up from his writing,
he disturbed Mr. Chandler, who was busy at his desk, by
saying he expected to have holiday on the morrow for the
whole day. Hanborough was just then in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s room;
Batley was out. Batley had been sent to execute a commission
at a distance, and would not be back till evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; responded Tom Chandler, laughing at
MacEveril&rsquo;s modest request, so modestly put. &ldquo;What else
would you like, Dick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick laughed too. &ldquo;That will serve me for the present
moment, Mr. Chandler,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dick, I&rsquo;m sorry to deny you, but you can&rsquo;t have
it. You have a conscience to ask it, young man, when you
know the Worcester Sessions are close at hand, and we are
so busy here we don&rsquo;t know which way to turn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to take it,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mean you to; understand that. See here,
Dick: I won&rsquo;t be harder than I&rsquo;m obliged; I should like to
go to the pic-nic myself, though there&rsquo;s no chance of that
for me. Come here in good time in the morning, get
through as much work as you can, and I daresay we can let
you off at one o&rsquo;clock. There!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This concession did not satisfy MacEveril. When Mr.
Hanborough came in from the other room he found the
young man exercising his saucy tongue upon Tom
Chandler, calling him a &ldquo;Martinet,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Red Indian Freebooter,&rdquo;
and other agreeable names, which he may have
brought with him from Australia. Tom, ever sweet-tempered,
took it all pleasantly, and bade him go on with
his work.</p>

<p>That interlude passed. At half-past four o&rsquo;clock MacEveril
went out, as usual, to get his tea, leaving Chandler and
Hanborough in the office, each writing at his own desk.
Presently the former paused; looked fixedly at the mortgage-deed
he was engaged upon, and then got up to carry it to
the old clerk. As he was crossing the room the postman
came in, put a small pile of letters into Mr. Chandler&rsquo;s hand,
and went out again. Tom looked down at the letters but
did not disturb them; he laid them down upon Mr.
Hanborough&rsquo;s desk whilst he showed him the parchment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much like this one clause, Hanborough,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
said. &ldquo;Just read it; it&rsquo;s very short. Would it be binding
on the other party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were both reading the clause, heads together, when
Mr. Paul was heard speaking in haste. &ldquo;Chandler! Tom
Chandler! Come here directly&rdquo;&mdash;and Tom turned and
went at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Hanborough there?&rdquo; cried Mr. Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him to come in also; no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Paul wanted them to witness his signature to a deed
which had to go off by the evening post. That done, he
detained them for a minute upon some other matter; after
which, Hanborough left the room. Chandler turned to
follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring the letters in as soon as they come,&rdquo; said Mr.
Paul. &ldquo;There may be one from Burnaby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they have come,&rdquo; replied Tom; and he went into
the other room and brought the letters to the lawyer.</p>

<p>It was this which Tom Chandler now related to his
master and to Mr. Preen. By dint of exercising his own
memory and referring to his day-book, Mr. Paul was enabled
to say that the letters that past afternoon were four in
number, and to state from whom they came. There was no
letter amongst them from Mr. Preen; none at all from
Duck Brook. So there it was: the letter seemed to have
mysteriously vanished; either out of the post bag despatched
by Mrs. Sym, or else after its arrival at Islip. The latter
was of course the more probable; since, as Dame Sym had
herself remarked, once a letter was shut up in the bag, there
it must remain; it could not vanish from it.</p>

<p>But, assuming this to be the case, how and where had it
vanished? From the Islip post-office? Or from the postman&rsquo;s
hands when carrying it out for delivery? Or from
Mr. Paul&rsquo;s front room?</p>

<p>They were yet speaking when Dale the postman walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in. He came to say that he had been exercising his mind
upon the afternoons of the past week and could now distinguish
Wednesday from the others. He recalled it by
remembering that it was the afternoon of the accident in the
street, when a tax-cart was overturned and the driver had
broken his arm; and he could positively say that he had
that afternoon delivered the letters to Mr. Chandler himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we remember all that ourselves, Dale,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Paul, somewhat testily. &ldquo;The thing we want
you to remember is, whether you observed amidst the
letters one with a large red seal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dale shook his head. &ldquo;No, sir, I did not. The letters
lay one upon another, address upwards, and I took no
particular notice of them. There were four or five of them,
I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; corrected the lawyer. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all, Dale, for
the present. The letter is lost, and we must consider what
to do in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, it was all very well to say that to Dale, but what
<em>could</em> they do? How set about it? To begin with, Preen
did not know the number of the note, but supposed he
might get it from Mr. Todhetley. He stayed so long in
discussion with the lawyer, that his son, waiting in the gig
outside, grew tired and the horse impatient.</p>

<p>Oliver was almost ready to die of weariness, when an
acquaintance of his came out of the Bell. Fred Scott; a
dashing young fellow, who had more money than brains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said Oliver. And Scott got into the gig.</p>

<p>They were driving slowly about and talking fast, when two
young ladies came into view at the end of the street. Oliver
threw the reins to his friend, got out in a trice and met
them. No need to say that one of them was Emma
Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Oliver to her, lifting his hat
from his suddenly flushed face, as he shook hands with both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of them. &ldquo;I left two books at your house yesterday: did
you get them? The servant said you were out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I had them; and I thank you very much,&rdquo;
answered Emma, with a charming smile: whilst Mary
MacEveril went away to feast her eyes at the milliner&rsquo;s
window. &ldquo;I have begun one of them already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane said you would like to read them; and so&mdash;I&mdash;I
left them,&rdquo; returned Oliver, with the hesitating shyness of
true love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you, Sir. Oliver, to bring them over,
and I am sorry I was not at home,&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;When
are you and Jane coming to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With her dimpled face all smiles, her blue eyes beaming
upon him, her ready handshake still tingling in his pulses,
her cordial tones telling of pleasure, how could that fascinated
young man do otherwise than believe in her? The world
might talk of her love for Tom Chandler: he did not and
would not believe it held a grain of truth. Oh, if he could
but know that she loved <em>him</em>! Mary MacEveril turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma, are you not coming? We have that silk to
match, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With another handshake, another sweet smile, she went
away with Mary. Oliver said adieu, his heart on his lips.
All his weariness was gone, lost in a flood of sunshine.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen was seen, coming along. Scott got out of the
gig, and Oliver got into it. Preen took his seat and the
reins, and drove off.</p>

<p>Mr. Paul went home to dinner at the usual hour that
evening, but the clerks remained beyond the time for
closing. Work had been hindered, and had to be done.
Batley was the first to leave; the other two lingered behind,
talking of the loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the most surprising thing that has happened for a
long while,&rdquo; remarked Hanborough. He had locked his
desk and had his hat and gloves at his elbow. &ldquo;That letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
has been stolen, Mr. Chandler; it has not been accidentally
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; assented Tom. &ldquo;Stolen&mdash;I fear&mdash;from here.
From this very room that you and I are standing in, Hanborough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My suspicions, sir, were directed to the Islip post-office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish mine were,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;think,
mind, for we cannot be sure&mdash;that the post-office is the right
quarter to look to. You see the letters were left here on
your desk, while we were occupied with Mr. Paul in his
room. About two minutes, I suppose, we stayed with him;
perhaps three. Did anyone come in during that time,
Hanborough, and take the letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hanborough drew off his spectacles, which he wore
out of doors as well as in; he was sure to take them off
when anything disturbed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who would do such a thing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Tom laughed a little. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t, old friend, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t; but there may be people in the neighbourhood
who would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubts were presenting themselves to Michael Hanborough&rsquo;s
mind: he did not &ldquo;see&rdquo; this, as the saying runs.
&ldquo;Why should anyone single out that one particular letter to
take, and leave the rest?&rdquo; he resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That point puzzles me,&rdquo; remarked Tom. &ldquo;If the letter
was singled out, as you put it, from the rest, I should say
the thief must have known it contained money: and who
could, or did, know that? I wish I had carried the letters
in with me when Mr. Paul called to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the letters had been left alone for a whole day in our
office, I should never have supposed they were not safe,&rdquo;
said the clerk, impulsively. &ldquo;But, now that my attention
has been drawn to this, I must mention something, Mr.
Chandler.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the master called me in after you, I followed you
in through that door,&rdquo; he began, pointing to the door of
communication between the two rooms. &ldquo;But I left it by
the other, the passage door, chancing to be nearest to it
at the moment. As I went out, I saw the green baize door
swinging, and supposed that someone had come in;
MacEveril, perhaps, from his tea. But he had not done so.
I found neither him nor anyone else; the room here was
vacant as when I left it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The green baize door stood in the passage, between the
street door, always open in the daytime, and the door that
led into the front office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seeing no one here, I concluded I was mistaken; and
I have never thought of it from that hour to this,&rdquo; continued
the clerk. &ldquo;No, not even when it came out that a letter had
been lost with a bank-note in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom nodded his head several times, as much as to say
that was when the thief must have come in. &ldquo;And now,
Hanborough, I&rsquo;ll tell you something in turn,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Dale put the letters into my hand that afternoon, as you
know; and I laid them on your desk here while showing
you that clause in the mortgage deed. Later, when I took
up the letters to carry them to Mr. Paul, an idea struck me
that the packet felt thinner. It did indeed. I of course
supposed it to be only fancy, and let it slip from my mind.
I have never thought of it since&mdash;as you say by the green
door&mdash;until this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael Hanborough, who had put his spectacles on
again, turned them upon his young master, and dropped his
voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it that&mdash;that we may suspect, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say yourself, Hanborough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to say. Is it&mdash;MacEveril?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo; replied Tom, in the same low tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
&ldquo;But while there are reasons for suspecting him, there are
also reasons against it,&rdquo; he added, after a pause. &ldquo;MacEveril
was in debt, petty little odds and ends of things which he
owes about the place and elsewhere; that&rsquo;s one reason why
money would be useful to him. Then his running away
looks suspicious; and another reason is that there&rsquo;s positively
no one else to suspect. All that seems to tell against him;
but on the other hand, MacEveril, though random and
heedless, is a gentleman and has a gentleman&rsquo;s instincts, and
I do <em>not</em> think he would be guilty of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and I can&rsquo;t think it, either,&rdquo; said Michael Hanborough;
&ldquo;despite his faults and his saucy tongue, I liked
him. He did not come in again that afternoon till half-past
five, I remember. I told him he was late; he answered,
laughing, that he had dropped asleep over his tea&mdash;though
I didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If MacEveril really took the letter, how had he ascertained
that it contained money?&rdquo; mused Tom Chandler.
&ldquo;Hanborough, at present I think this suspicion had better
lie entirely between ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Chandler, and so do I. Perhaps a few days
may bring forth something to confirm or dispel it.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Preen was a great deal too anxious and restless to let the
following day pass over quietly; and on that Sunday afternoon
when we were all sitting in the garden at Crabb Cot,
under the scent and shade of the large syringa trees, he
walked in. His little dark face looked darker than ever,
the scowl of pain on his brow deeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t take anything,&rdquo; he said, in answer to the
Squire&rsquo;s hospitable offers of having wine, or ale, or lemonade
brought out. &ldquo;Thirsty? Yes, I am thirsty, Squire, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
is with worry, not with the walk. Wine and lemonade won&rsquo;t
relieve that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, sitting down to face us, in a swinging American
chair, which Tod had brought out for his own benefit,
Gervais Preen surprised us with the history of his mysterious
loss, and inquired whether the Squire could give him the
number of the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; replied the Squire; &ldquo;my name is on the
note also; you made me write it, you know. How on earth
has it got lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just one of those things there&rsquo;s no accounting for,&rdquo;
said Preen, bending forward in his earnestness. &ldquo;The
letter left Duck Brook in safety; I posted it myself, and
Mrs. Sym took notice of it when she shut it up in the bag.
That is as far as it can be traced. The Islip post-office,
though not remembering it in particular, have no doubt
it reached them, as it could not have been lost from the
bag, or that they sent it out for delivery to Mr. Paul by
Dale, who is cautious and trustworthy. Paul declares it
never reached him; and of course <em>he</em> is trustworthy. Dale
says, and it is a fact, that he delivered the letters that
afternoon into Mr. Chandler&rsquo;s own hands. One cannot
see where to look for a weak point, you perceive, Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire was rubbing his face, the account having put
it into a white heat. &ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;It
reminds me of that five-pound note of mine which was
changed in the post for a stolen one! You remember <em>that</em>,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday, the sixteenth, was the day it ought to have
reached old Paul!&rdquo; exclaimed Tod, who was balancing
himself on the branch of a tree. &ldquo;Why, that was the day
before the pic-nic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if it was?&rdquo; retorted Preen, enraged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
everybody should bring up that pic-nic in conjunction with
his loss. &ldquo;The pic-nic had nothing to do with my bank-note
and letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly not,&rdquo; agreed Tod, laughing at his ire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should advertise, Preen,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;and I
should call in the detectives. They&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like detectives,&rdquo; growled Preen, interrupting him,
&ldquo;and I think advertising might do more harm than good.
I must get my money back somehow; I can&rsquo;t afford to
lose it. But as to those detectives&mdash;&mdash; Mercy upon us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the ardour of declamation, Mr. Preen had bent a little
too forward. The chair backed from under him, and he
came down upon the grass, hands and knees. Tod choked
with laughter, and dashed off to get rid of it. The man
gathered himself up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nasty tilting things, those chairs are!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t trouble, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; for Mrs. Todhetley had
sprung forward; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no harm done. And if you don&rsquo;t
mind giving me the number of the note to-day, Squire, I
shall be much obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He declined to stay for tea, saying he wanted to get back
home. When he and the Squire went indoors, we talked of
the loss; Mrs. Todhetley thought it strangely unaccountable.</p>

<p>As the days went on, and the bank-note did not turn up,
Mr. Preen fell into the depths of gloom. He had lost no
time in proceeding to the Old Bank, at Worcester&mdash;from
whence Mr. Todhetley had drawn the note, in conjunction
with other notes&mdash;recounting to its principals the history of
its loss, and giving in its number, together with the information
that Mr. Todhetley&rsquo;s name was written on it. The bank
promised to make inquiries of other banks, and to detain
the note should it be paid in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if <em>that</em> were likely!&rdquo; groaned Preen. &ldquo;A rogue
filching a note would not go and pay it into the place it
came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Chandler was gazetted the partner of Mr. Paul,
the firm to be known henceforth as Paul and Chandler. In
the first private conference that the young man held with
his partner, he imparted to him the suspicions which he and
Hanborough held of Dick MacEveril. For as that erratic
gentleman continued to absent himself, and the time was
going on without bringing a shadow of doubt upon anyone
else, the new partner felt that in duty he must speak to his
chief and elder. Old Paul was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed testily. &ldquo;And
why couldn&rsquo;t you or Hanborough mention this before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;for one thing I was always expecting
something might crop up to decide it one way or another;
and, to tell the truth, sir, I cannot bring myself to believe
that MacEveril did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a villainous young dog for impudence, but&mdash;to
do such a thing as that? No, I can hardly think it,
either,&rdquo; concluded the lawyer.</p>

<p>That same evening, after his dinner, Mr. Paul betook
himself to Oak Mansion, to an interview with his old friend,
Captain MacEveril. Not to accuse that scapegrace nephew
of the Captain&rsquo;s to his face, but to gather a hint or two
about him, if any might be gathered.</p>

<p>The very first mention of Dick&rsquo;s name set the old sailor
off. His right foot was showing symptoms of gout just
then; between that and Dick he had no temper at all.
Calming down presently, he called his man to produce
tobacco and grog. They sat at the open window, smoking
a pipe apiece, the glasses on a stand between them, and
the lame foot upon a stool. For the expost-captain made
a boast that he did not give in to that enemy of his any
more than he had ever given in to an enemy at a sea-fight.
The welcome evening breeze blew in upon them through the
open bow window, with the sweet-scent of the July roses;
and the sky was gorgeous with the red sunset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Dick, you ask,&rdquo; exploded the Captain. &ldquo;How
should I know where he is? Hang him! When he has
taken his fill of London shows with that Australian companion
of his, he&rsquo;ll make his way back again here, I reckon.
Write? Not he. He knows he&rsquo;d get a letter back from
me, Paul, if he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leading up to it by degrees, talking of this and that,
and especially of the mysterious loss of Preen&rsquo;s note, the
lawyer spoke doubtingly of whether it could have been lost
out of his own office, and, if so, who had taken it. &ldquo;That
young rascal would not do such a thing, you know, MacEveril,&rdquo;
he carelessly remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Dick? No, no, he&rsquo;d not do that,&rdquo; said the
Captain, promptly. &ldquo;Though I&rsquo;ve known young fellows
venture upon queer things when they were hard up for
money. Dick&rsquo;s honest to the backbone. Had he wanted
money to travel with, he&rsquo;d have wormed it out of my wife
by teasing, but he wouldn&rsquo;t steal it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About that time, a day or so before it, he drew
out the linings of his pockets as he sat at his desk, and
laughingly assured Hanborough, that he had not a coin of
ready money in the world,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; assented the Captain. &ldquo;Coin never
stays in <em>his</em> pockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where he found the money to travel
with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pledged his watch and chain maybe,&rdquo; returned the
Captain with composure. &ldquo;He would be quite equal to
<em>that</em>. Stockleigh, the fellow he is with in London, had
brought home heaps of gold, &rsquo;twas said; he no doubt
stands treat for Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Paul did not, could not, say anything more definite.
He thought of nothing else as he walked home; now saying
to himself that Dick had stolen the money, now veering over
to the Captain&rsquo;s opinion that Dick was incapable of doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
so. The uncertainty bothered him, and he hated to be
bothered.</p>

<p>The man to whom the money was owing, Robert Derrick,
was becoming very troublesome. Hardly a day passed but
he marched into Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office, to press for payment,
threatening to take steps if he did not get it shortly. The
morning following the lawyer&rsquo;s visit to Captain MacEveril,
he went in again, vowing it was for the last time, for that he
should cite Mr. Preen before the County Court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mark you this,&rdquo; he added to Hanborough, with
whom the colloquy was taking place, &ldquo;some past matters
will come out that Preen wants kept in. He&rsquo;ll wish he had
paid me, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, old Paul overheard this, for the door was partly
open. Rugged in look, and in manner too when he chose
to be, he was not rugged at heart. He was saying to himself
that if this money had really been lost out of his office,
stolen possibly by one of his clerks, he might replace it
from his own pocket, to ward off further damage to Preen.
Preen had not at present a second ten-pound note to give,
could not find one anyway; Preen wished he could. Ten
pounds would not affect the lawyer&rsquo;s pocket at all: and his
resolution was taken. Ringing his bell, which was answered
by Batley, he bade him show Derrick to his room.</p>

<p>The man came in with a subdued face. He supposed he
had been overheard, and he did not care to offend Mr. Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot have you coming here to disturb my clerks,
Derrick,&rdquo; said the lawyer, with authority. &ldquo;If you write
out a receipt, I will pay you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sure enough that&rsquo;s all I want, sir,&rdquo; returned Derrick,
who was Irish. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t let the thing go on longer&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s Preen I&rsquo;d like to disturb, Lawyer Paul, not you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down yonder and write the receipt,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
shortly. &ldquo;You know how to word it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Derrick wrote the receipt and went off with the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pounds. And Gervais Preen said a few words of real thanks
to Mr. Paul in a low tone, when he heard of it.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, the thirteenth of July, exactly four
weeks to the day since the bank-note left Mr. Preen&rsquo;s
hands, he had news of it. The Old Bank at Worcester
wrote to him to say that the missing note had been paid in
the previous day, Monday, by a well-known firm of linen-drapers
in High Street. Upon which the bank made inquiry
of this firm as to whence they received the note, and the
answer, readily given, was that they had had it from a
neighbour opposite&mdash;the silversmith. The silversmith,
questioned in his turn, replied with equal readiness that it
had been given him in payment of a purchase by young Mr.
Todhetley.</p>

<p>Preen, hardly believing his eyes, went off with all speed
to Islip, and laid the letter before Lawyer Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How can young
Todhetley have had the note in his possession? I am going
on to Crabb Cot to show the Squire the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; said the far-seeing lawyer, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do to
take this letter to Todhetley. Let us consider, first of all,
how we stand. There must be some mistake. The bank
and the silversmith have muddled matters between them;
they may have put young Todhetley&rsquo;s name into it through
seeing his father&rsquo;s on the bank-note. I will write at once to
Worcester and get it privately inquired into. You had
better leave it altogether in my hands, Preen, for the
present.&rdquo; A proposal Preen was glad to agree to.</p>

<p>Lawyer Paul wrote to another lawyer in Worcester with
whom he was on friendly terms, Mr. Corles; stating the
particulars of the case. That gentleman lost no time in the
matter; he made the inquiries himself, and speedily wrote
back to Islip.</p>

<p>There had been no mistake, as Mr. Paul had surmised.
The linen-drapers, a long-established and respectable firm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
as Paul knew, had paid the note into the Old Bank, with
other monies, in the ordinary course of business; and the
firm repeated to Mr. Corles that they had received it from
their neighbour, the silversmith.</p>

<p>The silversmith himself was from home at this time; he
was staying at Malvern for his health, going to Worcester on
the market days only, Saturdays and Wednesdays, when the
shop expected to be busy. He had one shopman only, a
Mr. Stephenson, who took charge in his master&rsquo;s absence.
Stephenson assured Mr. Corles that he had most positively
taken the note from Squire Todhetley&rsquo;s son. Young Mr.
Todhetley had gone into the shop, purchased some trifling
article, giving the note in payment, and received the change
in gold. Upon referring to his day-book, Stephenson found
that the purchase was made and the note paid to him during
the morning of Thursday, the seventeenth of June.</p>

<p>When this communication from Mr. Corles reached Islip,
it very much astonished old Paul. &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
flinging it upon his table when he had read it; then
he took it up and read it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Chandler,&rdquo; said he, calling his new partner to
him, &ldquo;what do you make of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Chandler read it twice over in his turn. &ldquo;If Joseph
Todhetley did change the note,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;he must have
done it as a practical joke, and be keeping up the joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hardly likely,&rdquo; returned Mr. Paul. &ldquo;If he has, he
will have a bad quarter of an hour when the Squire hears
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On this same morning, Thursday, we were preparing for
Worcester; the Squire was going to drive us in&mdash;that is,
myself and Tod. The phaeton was actually being brought
round to the gate and we were getting our hats, when
Tom Chandler walked in, saying he had come upon a little
matter of business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No time to attend to it now, Tom,&rdquo; said the Squire, all
in a bustle; &ldquo;just starting for Worcester. You look hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hot, for I came along at a trotting pace,&rdquo; said
Tom; &ldquo;the matter I have come upon makes me hot also.
Mr. Todhetley, I must explain it, short as your time may be;
it is very important, and&mdash;and peculiar. Mr. Paul charged
me to say that he would have come himself, but he is
obliged to stay at home to keep an appointment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, then,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;and make it as brief
as you can. Johnny, lad, tell Giles to drive the horses
slowly about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I got back, after telling Giles, Tom Chandler
had two letters in his hand; and was apologising to the
Squire and to Tod for what he was obliged to enter upon.
Then he added, in a few words, that the lost bank-note had
come to light; it had been changed at Worcester, at the
silversmith&rsquo;s in High Street, by, it was asserted, young Mr.
Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; cried the Squire sharply.</p>

<p>To explain what he meant, Tom Chandler read aloud the
two letters he held; the short one, which had been first
addressed to Mr. Preen by the Old Bank, and then the
longer one written by Mr. Corles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edward Corles must be a fool to write that!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Squire in his hot fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he is not that, you know,&rdquo; said Tom Chandler.
&ldquo;The question is, Squire, what the grounds can be upon
which they so positively state it. According to their
assertion, young Mr. Todhetley changed the note at the
silversmith&rsquo;s on the morning of Thursday, the seventeenth
of June.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Mr. Todhetley&rdquo; in a general way was just as hot
as his father, apt to fly out for nothing. I expected to see
him do so now. Instead of which, he had a broad smile on
his face, evidently regarding the accusation as a jest. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
had perched himself on the arm of the sofa, and sat there
grinning.</p>

<p>This struck Tom Chandler. &ldquo;Did you do it for a joke?&rdquo;
he asked promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; rejoined Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change the note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only conclusion Mr. Paul and I could come to was,
that&mdash;if you had done it&mdash;you did it to play a practical joke
upon Preen, and were keeping it up still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire struck his hand in anger upon the table by
which he sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Joe? A practical joke?
Did you do the thing, or didn&rsquo;t you? Speak out seriously.
Don&rsquo;t sit there, grinning like a Chinese image.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why of course I did not do it, father. How should
Preen&rsquo;s bank-note get into my hands? Perhaps Johnny
there got it and did it. He is sometimes honoured by
being put down as your son, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was jesting still. The Squire was not in a mood for
jesting; Tom Chandler either. A thought struck me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say the note was changed on Thursday, the
seventeenth of June?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say so,&rdquo; answered Tom Chandler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that was the day of the picnic at Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s.
Neither I nor Tod left the house at all until we went
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why bless me, so it was! the seventeenth,&rdquo; cried the
Squire. &ldquo;I can prove that they were at home till four
o&rsquo;clock: the Beeles were spending the day here from
Pigeon Green. Now, Chandler, how has this false report
arisen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as much at sea as you can be, sir,&rdquo; said Tom
Chandler. &ldquo;Neither I nor Paul can, or do, believe it&mdash;or
understand why the other people stick to it so positively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
You are going into Worcester, Squire; make your own
inquiries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;You had better drive
in with us, Chandler, if you can. Giles can stay at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was thus decided, and we started for Worcester,
Chandler sitting beside the Squire. And the way the Squire
touched up Bob and Blister, and the pace we flew along at,
was a sight for the road to see.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Thursday morning, the seventeenth of June&mdash;for we have
to go back to that day. High Street was basking in the rays
of the hot sun; foot passengers, meeting each other on the
scorching pavement, lifted their hats for a moment&rsquo;s air, and
said what a day it was going to be. The clean, bright shops
faced each other from opposite sides. None of their wares
looked more attractive than those displayed in the two
windows of the silversmith.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephenson&mdash;a trustworthy, civil little man of thirty,
with a plain face and sandy hair that stood upright on
his head&mdash;was keeping guard over his master&rsquo;s goods, some
of them being very valuable. The shop was a long one and
he was far down in it, behind the left-hand counter. Before
him lay a tray of small articles of jewellery, some of which
he was touching up with a piece of wash-leather. He did
not expect to be busy that day; the previous day, Wednesday,
had been a busy one, so many country people came
into town for the market.</p>

<p>While thus engaged a gentleman, young, good looking,
and well dressed, entered the shop. Mr. Stephenson went
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have called for Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s brooch,&rdquo; said the
stranger. &ldquo;Is it ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What brooch, sir?&rdquo; returned Stephenson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one she left with you to be mended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shopman felt a little puzzled. He said he did not
remember that any brooch had been left by that lady to be
mended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Todhetley of Crabb Cot,&rdquo; explained the applicant,
perhaps thinking the man was at fault that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, I know who you mean; I know Mrs.
Todhetley. But she has not left any brooch here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has; she left it to be mended. I was to call
to-day and ask for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stephenson turned to reach the book in which articles left
to be mended were entered, with their owners&rsquo; names.
Perhaps his master might have taken in the brooch and
omitted to tell him. But no such entry was recorded in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is a mistake, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Had Mrs.
Todhetley left a brooch, or anything else, for repair, it
would be entered here. She may have taken it to some
other shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; it is yours I was to call at. She bought it here
a few months ago,&rdquo; added the young man. &ldquo;She came in
to ask you about the polishing-up of an old silver cake-basket,
and you showed her the brooches, some you had
just had down from London, and she bought one of them
and gave four guineas for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stephenson remembered the transaction perfectly. He had
stood by while his principal showed and sold the brooch to
Mrs. Todhetley. Four only of these brooches had been
sent to them on approval by their London agent, they were
something quite new. Mrs. Todhetley admired them
greatly; said she wanted to make a wedding present to a
young lady about to be married, but had not meant to give
as much as four guineas. However, the beauty of the
brooch tempted her; she bought it, and took it home.</p>

<p>Stephenson&rsquo;s silence, while he was recalling this to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
memory, caused the gentleman to think his word was
doubted, and he entered into further particulars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was last March, I think,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The brooch is
a rather large one; a white cornelian stone, or something of
that sort, with a raised spray of flowers upon it, pink and
gold; the whole surrounded by a border of gold filagree
work. I never saw a nicer brooch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, sir, it was just as you say; I recollect it all
quite well. Mrs. Todhetley bought it to give away as a
wedding present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the wedding never came off,&rdquo; said the young man,
with ease. &ldquo;Before she had time to despatch the brooch,
news came to her of the rupture.&mdash;So she had to keep it
herself: and the best thing too, the Squire said. Well, it
is that brooch I have come for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I assure you it has not been left with us, Mr.
Todhetley,&rdquo; said Stephenson, presuming he was speaking to
the Squire&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little pink flower got broken off last week as Mrs.
Todhetley was undoing her shawl; she brought it in at
once to be mended,&rdquo; persisted the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not here indeed, sir,&rdquo; reiterated Stephenson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry to hear it is broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t take it anywhere but to the place it was
bought at, would she? I&rsquo;m sure it was here I had to come
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stephenson felt all abroad. He did not think it likely the
brooch would be taken elsewhere, and began to wonder
whether his master had taken it in, and forgotten all
about it. Opening a shallow drawer or two in the counter,
in one of which articles for repair were put, in the other
the repaired articles when finished, he searched both, but
could not see the brooch. This took him some little time,
as most of the things were in paper and he had to undo it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the applicant amused himself by looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the articles displayed under the glass frame on the counter.
He seemed to be rather struck with some very pretty
pencils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are those pencils gold?&rdquo; he inquired of Stephenson,
when the latter came forward with the news that the brooch
was certainly not in the shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; they are silver gilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lifting the glass lid, Stephenson took out the tray on
which the pencils and other things lay, and put it right
under the young man&rsquo;s nose, in the persuasive manner
peculiar to shopmen. The pencils were chased richly
enough for gold, and had each a handsome stone at the
end, which might or might not be real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve shillings each, sir. We bought them a bargain;
from a bankrupt&rsquo;s stock in fact; and can afford to sell them
as such.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to take this one, I think,&rdquo; said the young
man, choosing out one with a pink topaz. &ldquo;Wait a bit,
though: I must see if I&rsquo;ve enough change to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, don&rsquo;t trouble about that; we will put it down
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, that won&rsquo;t do. One, two, four, six. Six
shillings; all I have in the world,&rdquo; he added laughing, as he
counted the coin in his porte-monnaie, &ldquo;and that I want.
You can change me a ten-pound note, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The purchaser extracted the note from a secret pocket of
his porte-monnaie, and handed it to the shopman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Squire&rsquo;s name is on it,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>Which caused Stephenson to look at the back. Sure
enough, there it was&mdash;&ldquo;J. Todhetley,&rdquo; in the Squire&rsquo;s own
handwriting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me gold, if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stephenson handed over nine pounds in gold and eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
shillings in silver. He then wrapped the pencil in soft white
paper, and handed over that.</p>

<p>Wishing the civil shopman good morning, the young man
left. He stood outside the door for a minute, looking about
him, and then walked briskly up the street. While Stephenson
locked up the ten-pound note in the cash-box.</p>

<p>There it lay, snug and safe, for two or three weeks. One
day Stephenson, finding he had not enough change for a
customer who came in to pay a bill, ran over to the
draper&rsquo;s opposite and got change for it there. These were
the particulars which Stephenson had furnished, and
furnished readily, upon inquiries being made of him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Squire Todhetley drove like the wind, and we soon
reached Worcester, alighting as usual at the Star-and-Garter.
The Squire&rsquo;s commotion had been growing all the way; that
goes without telling. He wanted to take the bank first; Tom
Chandler recommended that it should be the silversmith&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bank comes first in the way,&rdquo; snapped the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, sir; but we can soon come back to it when
we have heard what the others say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet I think he would have gone into the bank head-foremost,
as we passed it, but chance had it that we met Corles,
the lawyer, at the top of Broad Street. Turning quickly
into High Street, on his way from his office, he came right
upon us. The Squire pinned him by the button-hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very man I wanted to see,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;And now
you&rsquo;ll be good enough to tell me, Edward Corles, what you
meant by that rigmarole you wrote to Paul yesterday about
my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell what was meant, Squire, any more than you
can; I only wrote in accordance with my information,&rdquo;
said Mr. Corles, shaking hands with the rest of us. &ldquo;You
have done well to come over; and I will accompany you
now, if you like, to see Stephenson.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The Squire put his arm within the younger man&rsquo;s, and
marched on down High Street to the silversmith&rsquo;s, never so
much as looking at the bank door. Stephenson was in the
shop alone: such a lot of us, it seemed, turning in!</p>

<p>The Squire, hot and impulsive, attacked him as he had
attacked Edward Corles. What did Stephenson mean by
making that infamous accusation about his son?</p>

<p>It took Stephenson aback, as might be seen; his eyes
opened and his hair stood on end straighter than ever.
Looking from one to the other of us, he last looked at
Mr. Corles, as if seeking an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do, to begin with, Stephenson,
is to relate to Squire Todhetley and these gentlemen the
particulars you gave me yesterday morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Corles.
&ldquo;I mean when you took the bank-note, a month ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without more ado, Stephenson quietly followed the
advice; he seemed of as calm a temperament as the Squire
was the contrary, and recited the particulars just given.
The Squire&rsquo;s will was good to interrupt at every second
word, but Mr. Corles begged him to listen to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; cried he at last, &ldquo;all true, I
dare say; what I want to know is, how you came to pitch
upon that customer as being my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was your son, sir. He was young Mr. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; retorted the Squire. &ldquo;Was this he?&rdquo;
drawing Tod forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; certainly not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is my only son; except a little who is not yet
much more than out of his petticoats. Come! what do you
say now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stephenson looked again at one and the other of us. His
pale face took a sort of thoughtful haze as if he had passed
into a fog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been young Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo; spoke he;
&ldquo;everything seemed to uphold the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you turn obstinate and uphold what is <em>not</em>
the fact,&rdquo; reproved the Squire. &ldquo;When I tell you this is
my only son, except the child, how dare you dispute my
word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It should be stated that Stephenson had been with the
silversmith since the beginning of the year only, and had
come from Birmingham. He knew Mr. and Mrs. Todhetley
by sight, from their coming sometimes to the shop,
but he had never yet seen Tod or me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you want Squire Todhetley&rsquo;s word
confirmed, Stephenson, but I can do so if necessary,&rdquo; said
Mr. Corles. &ldquo;This is his only grown-up son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir, of course I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Stephenson. &ldquo;This
gentleman,&rdquo; looking at Tod, &ldquo;does not bear any resemblance
to the one who changed the note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo; said Tom Chandler, speaking for
the first time; and he asked it because his thoughts were
full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was fair, sir,&rdquo; replied Stephenson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What height?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About middle height. A young, slender man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well dressed? Spoke like a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite like a gentleman, and very well dressed
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as MacEveril was that morning, on the strength of
getting to the picnic,&rdquo; ran through Tom Chandler&rsquo;s thoughts.
&ldquo;Did he come off here first, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed to know all about you, sir, just as though he
lived at your house,&rdquo; said Stephenson to the Squire; &ldquo;and
Mrs. Todhetley sent him for her brooch that day. Perhaps
you may know, sir, who it was she sent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sent! why, nobody,&rdquo; spluttered the Squire. &ldquo;It must
have been a planned thing. The brooch is not broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said the little pink flower had got broken off, and
that Mrs. Todhetley did it with her shawl,&rdquo; persisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Stephenson, unable to stare away his perplexity. And I
think we were all feeling perplexed too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knew what the brooch cost, and that it was bought
for a wedding present, and that Mrs. Todhetley kept the
brooch for herself because the wedding did not come off,&rdquo;
went on Stephenson. &ldquo;How could I suppose, sir, it was
anybody but your own son? Why once I called him
&lsquo;Mr. Todhetley;&rsquo; I remember it quite well; and he did
not tell me I was mistaken. Rely upon it, if you&rsquo;ll excuse
me for saying so, Squire Todhetley, that it is some young
gentleman who is intimate at your house and familiar with
all its ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang him for a young rogue!&rdquo; retorted the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your own name was on the note, sir, which he bade
me notice, and all! And&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t see how it was
possible to <em>help</em> falling into the mistake that he came from
you,&rdquo; concluded Stephenson, with a slightly injured accent.</p>

<p>Upon which the Squire, having had time to take in the
bearings of the matter, veered round altogether to the same
opinion, and said so, and shook hands with Stephenson when
we departed.</p>

<p>Tom Chandler let us go on, remaining behind for a
minute or two. He wanted to put quietly a few questions
about the appearance of the young man who had changed
the note. He also examined the silver-gilt pencils, finally
buying one which was precisely similar, stone and all, to the
one which had been sold that other morning.</p>

<p>Stephenson answered the questions to the best of his
ability and recollection. And Tom Chandler found that
while on some points the description would have served
very well for that of Richard MacEveril, on other points it
did not seem to fit in with it at all.</p>

<h2>A TRAGEDY</h2>


<h3>IV.&mdash;OLIVER</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Dinner was over. Emma Paul had gone out to stroll in
the shady garden and wait for the evening breeze that
would soon come on, and was so delightful after the heat of
the day. Her father remained at the table. He was slowly
sipping at his one glass of port wine, which he took in a
large claret glass, when the door opened and Thomas
Chandler entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Paul. &ldquo;So you <em>are</em> back, are you, young
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went on to Worcester, sir,&rdquo; explained Tom; who
though he was now made Mr. Paul&rsquo;s partner, could not get
rid all at once of the old mode of addressing him. Managing
clerks in these days, who are qualified solicitors, do not
condescend to say &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; to their chief, no matter though he
be their elder by half a life-time; but they did in the days
gone by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I got to Crabb Cot this morning, sir, Mr. Todhetley
was on the point of starting for Worcester in the
phaeton with his son and Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; went on Tom.
&ldquo;After listening to the news I took him, he naturally
wished me to go also, and I did so. He was in a fine way
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you need not have stayed at Worcester all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, being there, I thought&mdash;after I had conferred with
Corles at his office upon this other matter&mdash;I should do
well to go on to Oddingley and see William Smith about
that troublesome business of his; so I hired a gig and went
there; and I&rsquo;ve just got back by train, walking from Crabb,&rdquo;
answered Tom Chandler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had any dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, thank you; and some tea also at Shrub Hill
station, while waiting for the train: this weather makes one
thirsty. No, thank you, sir,&rdquo; as Mr. Paul pushed the
decanter towards him; &ldquo;wine would only make me still
more thirsty than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw you looking so hot,&rdquo; remarked the old
lawyer.</p>

<p>Tom laughed, and rubbed his face. The walk from
Crabb was no light one: and, of course, with Miss Emma
at the end of it, he had come at a steaming pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and what did you and Todhetley make of the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the day, as may readily be understood, when we
had gone to Worcester to have it out at the silversmith&rsquo;s.
Tom Chandler recounted all that passed, and repeated the
description given to himself by Stephenson of the fellow who
had changed the bank-note. Mr. Paul received it with an
impatient and not at all orthodox word, meant for Richard
MacEveril.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot feel sure, no, nor half sure, that it was
MacEveril,&rdquo; said Tom Chandler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have your feelings got to do with it?&rdquo; asked old
Paul, in his crusty way. &ldquo;It seems to me, the description
you give would be his very picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stephenson says he had blue eyes. Now Dick&rsquo;s are
brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eyes be sugared,&rdquo; retorted the lawyer. &ldquo;As if any man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
could swear to a chance customer&rsquo;s eyes after seeing them
for just a minute or two! It was Dick MacEveril; he
caught up the letter as it lay on Hanborough&rsquo;s desk in the
office and decamped with it; and went off the next day to
Worcester to get the note changed, as bold as though he had
been Dick Turpin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Tom was not convinced. He took out the pencil he
had bought and showed it to Mr. Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pretty thing, and
perhaps he may get traced by it. Do you forget,
Mr. Thomas, that the young rascal absented himself all that
day from the office on pretext of going to the picnic at
Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s, and that, as you told me, he never made his
appearance at the picnic until late in the afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; assented Tom. &ldquo;He said he had been to the
pigeon match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he said he had been to the moon, I suppose you&rsquo;d
believe it. Don&rsquo;t tell me! It was Dick MacEveril who
stole the note; every attendant circumstance helps to prove
it. There: we&rsquo;ll say no more about the matter, and you
can be off to the garden if you want to; I know you are
on thorns for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day the matter dropped into oblivion, and
nothing was allowed to transpire connecting MacEveril
with the theft. Mr. Paul enjoined silence, out of regard for
his old friend the captain, on Tom Chandler and Mr. Hanborough,
the only two, besides himself, who suspected Dick.
Some letters arrived at Islip about this time from Paris,
written by Dick: one to Captain MacEveril, another to
Mr. Paul, a third to his cousin Mary. He coolly said he
was gone to Paris for a few weeks with Jim Stockleigh, and
they were both enjoying themselves amazingly.</p>

<p>So, the ball of gossip not being kept up, the mysterious
loss of the letter containing the bank-note was soon forgotten.
Mr. Paul was too vexed to speak of it; it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a slur on his office; and he shielded Dick&rsquo;s good name for
his uncle&rsquo;s sake; whilst Preen was silent because he did not
wish the <em>debt</em> talked about.</p>

<p>We left Crabb Cot for Dyke Manor, carrying our wonder
with us. The next singular point to us was, how the
changer of the note could have been so well acquainted
with the circumstances attending the buying of the brooch.
Mrs. Todhetley would talk of it by the hour together,
suggesting now this person and now that; but never seeming
to hit upon a likely one.</p>

<p>July passed away, August also, and September came in.
On the Thursday in the first week of the latter month,
Emma Paul was to become Emma Chandler.</p>

<p>All that while, through all those months and weeks, poor
Oliver Preen had been having a bad time of it. No longer
able to buoy himself up with the delusive belief that
Emma&rsquo;s engagement to Chandler was nothing but a myth,
he had to accept it, and all the torment it brought him.
He had grown pale and thin; nervous also; his lips would
turn white if anyone spoke to him abruptly, his hot hand
trembled when in another&rsquo;s grasp. Jane thought he must
be suffering from some inward fever; she did not know
much about her brother&rsquo;s love for Emma, or dream that it
could be so serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I wish their wedding was over and done with;
Oliver might come to his proper senses then,&rdquo; Jane told
herself. &ldquo;He is very silly. <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t see much in Emma
Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>September, I say, came in. It was somewhat singular
that we should again be for just that one first week of it at
Crabb Cot. Sir Robert Tenby had invited the Squire to
take a few days&rsquo; shooting with him, and included Tod in
the invitation&mdash;to his wild delight. So Mr. and Mrs.
Todhetley went from Dyke Manor to Crabb Cot for the
week, and we accompanied them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Monday morning of this eventful week&mdash;and
terribly eventful it was destined to be&mdash;Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office
had a surprise. Richard MacEveril walked into it. He
was looking fresh and blooming, as if he had never heard
of such a thing as running away. Mr. Hanborough gazed
up at him from his desk as if he saw an apparition; Tite
Batley&rsquo;s red face seemed illumined by sudden sunshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and is nobody going to welcome me back?&rdquo;
cried Dick, as he put out his hand, in the silence, to Mr.
Hanborough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, we never expected to see you back; we
thought you had gone for good,&rdquo; answered Hanborough.</p>

<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;The two masters in there?&rdquo; he asked,
nodding his head at the inner door.</p>

<p>Hearing that they were, he went in. Old Paul, in his
astonishment, dropped a penful of ink upon a letter he was
writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where do you spring from?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my uncle&rsquo;s now, sir; got home last night. Been
having a rare time of it in Paris. I suppose I may take my
place at the desk again?&rdquo; added Dick.</p>

<p>The impudence of this supposition drove all Mr. Paul&rsquo;s
wisdom out of him. Motioning to Tom Chandler to close
the doors, he avowed to Dick what he was suspected of,
and accused him of taking the letter and the bank-note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, meeting the news with
equanimity. &ldquo;Go off with a letter of yours, sir, and a
bank-note! <em>Steal</em> it, do you mean? Why, you cannot
think I&rsquo;d be capable of such a dirty trick, Mr. Paul.
Indeed, sir, it wasn&rsquo;t me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was something in the genuine astonishment of
the young fellow, a certain honesty in his look and tone,
that told Mr. Paul his suspicion might be a mistaken one.
He recounted a brief outline of the facts, Tom Chandler
helping him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw the letter or the note, sir,&rdquo; persisted Dick.
&ldquo;I remember the Wednesday afternoon quite well. When
I went out to get my tea I met Fred Scott, and he persuaded
me into the Bull for a game at billiards. It was half-past
five before I got back here, and Mr. Hanborough blew me
up. He had not been able to get out to his own tea.
Batley was away that afternoon. No, no, sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t do
such a thing as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get the money to go away to London
with, young man?&rdquo; questioned old Paul, severely.</p>

<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;I won it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;upon my word
of honour, sir, I did. It was the day of the picnic, and I
persisted in going straight to it the first thing&mdash;which put
the office here in a rage, as it was busy. Well, in turning
out of here I again met Scott. He was hastening off to the
pigeon-shooting match. I went with him, intending to stay
only half an hour. But, once there, I couldn&rsquo;t tear myself
away. They were betting; I betted too, though I had only
half a crown in my pocket, and I won thirty shillings; and
I never got to Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s till the afternoon, when it was
close upon tea-time. Tom Chandler knows I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Chandler nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for winning that thirty shillings I could not have
got up to London, unless somebody had lent me some,&rdquo;
ran on Dick, who, once set going, was a rare talker. &ldquo;You
can ask anyone at that pigeon match, sir, whether I was not
there the whole time: so it is impossible I could have been
at Worcester, changing a bank-note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words brought to Mr. Paul a regret that he had <em>not</em>
thought to ask that question of some one of the sportsmen:
it would have set the matter at rest, so far as MacEveril was
concerned. And the suspicion had been so apparently well
grounded, as to prevent suspicion in other quarters.</p>

<p>Tom Chandler, standing beside Dick at Mr. Paul&rsquo;s
table, quietly laid a pencil upon it, as if intending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
write something down. Dick took it up and looked
at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pretty pencil!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It should be understood that in those past days, these
ornamental pencils were rare. They may be bought by the
bushel now. And Tom Chandler would have been convinced
by the tone, had he still needed conviction, that
Dick had not seen any pencil like it before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; struck in old Paul, a little repentant for having
so surely assumed Dick&rsquo;s guilt, and thankful on the captain&rsquo;s
account that it was a mistake: &ldquo;if you promise to be steady
at your work, young man, I suppose you may take your
place at the desk again. This gentleman here is going
a-roving this week,&rdquo; pointing the feather-end of his pen at
Tom Chandler, &ldquo;for no one knows how long; so you&rsquo;ll
have to stick to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know; I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; laughed Dick. &ldquo;I mean to get
a few minutes to dash into the church and see the wedding.
Hope you&rsquo;ll not dismiss me for it, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there; you go to your desk now, young man,
and ask Mr. Hanborough what you must do first,&rdquo; concluded
the lawyer.</p>

<p>It was not the only time on that same day that Thomas
Chandler displayed his pencil. Finding his theory, that
Dick MacEveril possessed the fellow one, to be mistaken,
he at once began to take every opportunity of showing it to
the world&mdash;which he had not done hitherto. Something
might possibly come of it, he thought. And something did.</p>

<p>Calling in at Colonel Letsom&rsquo;s in the evening, I found
Jane Preen there, and one or two more girls. The Squire
and Tod had not appeared at home yet, neither had Colonel
Letsom, who made one at the shooting-party; we decided
that Sir Robert must be keeping them to an unceremonious
dinner. Presently Tom Chandler came in, to bring a note
to the Colonel from Mr. Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob Letsom proposed a round game at cards&mdash;Speculation.
His sister, Fanny, objected; speculation was nothing but
screaming, she said, and we couldn&rsquo;t sit down to cards by
daylight. She proposed music; she thought great things
of her singing: Bob retorted that music might be shot, and
they talked at one another a bit. Finally we settled to play
at &ldquo;Consequences.&rdquo; This involves, as everyone knows,
sitting round a table with pencils and pieces of writing-paper.</p>

<p>I sat next to Tom Chandler, Jane Preen next to me.
Fanny was on the other side of Tom&mdash;but it is not necessary
to relate how we all sat. Before we had well begun, Chandler
put his pencil on the table, carelessly, and it rolled past me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that is Oliver&rsquo;s pencil!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, picking
it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is?&rdquo; quietly said Tom. &ldquo;That? No; it is
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane looked at it on all sides. &ldquo;It is exactly like one
that Oliver has,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It fell out of a drawer in his
room the other day, when I was counting up his collars and
handkerchiefs. He told me he brought it from Tours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I bought mine at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In taking the pencil from Jane, Tom&rsquo;s eye caught mine.
I did feel queer; he saw I did; but I think he was feeling
the same. Little doubt now who had changed the note!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not talk of it, will you?&rdquo; I whispered to Tom,
as we were dispersing about the room when the game
was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it shall not come out through me. I&rsquo;m
afraid, though, there&rsquo;s no mistake this time, Johnny. A
half doubt of it has crossed my mind at odd moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither would I talk of it, even to Tod. After all, it was
not proof positive. I had never, never thought of Oliver.</p>

<p>The Letsoms had a fine old garden, as all the gardens at
Crabb were, and we strolled out in the twilight. The sun
had set, but the sky was bright in the west. Valentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Chandler, for he had come in, kept of course by Jane
Preen&rsquo;s side. Anyone might see that it was, as Tod called
it, a gone case with them. It was no end of a pity, Val
being just as unsteady and uncertain as the wind.</p>

<p>People do bolder things in the gloaming than in the
garish daylight; and we fell to singing in the grotto&mdash;a
semi-circular, half-open space with seats in it, surrounded at
the back by the artificial rocks. Fanny began: she brought
out an old guitar and twanged at it and sang for us, &ldquo;The
Baron of Mowbray;&rdquo; where the false knight rides away
laughing from the Baron&rsquo;s door and the Baron&rsquo;s daughter:
that far-famed song of sixty years ago, which was said to
have made a fortune for its composer.</p>

<p>The next to take up the singing was Valentine Chandler:
and in listening to him you forgot all his short-comings.
Never man had sweeter voice than he; and in his singing
there was a singular charm impossible to be described. In
his voice also&mdash;I mean when he spoke&mdash;there was always
melody, and in his speech, when he chose to put it forth,
a persuasive eloquence. This might have been instrumental
in winning Jane Preen&rsquo;s heart; we are told that a man&rsquo;s
heart is lost through his eye, a woman&rsquo;s through her ear.
Poor Valentine! he might have been so nice a fellow&mdash;and
he was going to the bad as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>The song he chose was a ridiculous old ditty all about
love; it went to the tune of &ldquo;Di tanti palpiti.&rdquo; Val chose
it for Miss Jane and sung it to her; to her alone, mind
you; the rest of us went for nothing.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Here we meet, too soon to part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here to part will raise a smart,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Where none are set above thee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here I&rsquo;d vow to love thee well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could but words unseal the spell,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">I&rsquo;d tell thee how I&rsquo;ve loved thee.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s the rose that decks the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s the thorn that spreads the moor,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">And the birds that rest above thee.<br /></span>

<span class="i8">None e&rsquo;er were there but thee.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now, as you perceive, it is a most ridiculous song, foolish
as love-songs in general are. But had you been sitting
there with us in all the subtle romance imparted by the
witching hour of twilight, the soft air floating around, the
clear sky above, one large silver star trembling in its blue
depths, you would have felt entranced. The wonderful
melody of the singer&rsquo;s voice, his distinct enunciation, the
tender passion breathing through his soft utterance, and the
slight yet unmistakable emphasis given to the avowal of his
love, thrilled us all. It was as decided a declaration of
what he felt for Jane Preen as he could well make in this
world. Once he glanced at her, and only once throughout;
it was where I have placed the pause, as he placed it himself,
&ldquo;like thee&mdash;and me.&rdquo; As if his glance drew hers by
some irresistible fascination, Jane, who had been sitting
beneath the rock just opposite to him, her eyes cast down&mdash;as
he made that pause and glanced at her, I say, she
lifted them for a moment, and caught the glance. I may
live to be an old man, but I shall never forget Val&rsquo;s song
that night, or the charm it held for us. What, then, must it
have held for Jane? And it is because that song and its
charm lie still fresh on my memory, though many a year has
since worn itself out, that I inscribe it here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>As the singing came to an end, dying softly away, no one
for a moment or two broke the hushed silence that ensued.
Valentine was the first to do it. He got up from his seat;
went round to a ledge of rock and stood upon it, looking
out in the distance. Had the sea been near, one might
have thought he saw a ship, homeward bound.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Had the clerk of the weather been bribed with a purse of
gold, he could not have sent a finer day than Thursday
turned out to be. The sun shone, the air sparkled, and the
bells of Islip church rang out from the old steeple. Islip
was much behind other churches in many respects; so
primitive, indeed, in some of its ways, that had an edifice
of advanced views come sailing through the air to pay it a
visit, it would have turned tail again and sailed away; but
Islip could boast of one thing few churches can boast of&mdash;a
delightful peal of bells.</p>

<p>The wedding took place at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and was a
quiet one. Its attendants were chiefly confined to the
parties themselves and their immediate relatives, but that
did not prevent other people from flocking in to see it.</p>

<p>I and Dick MacEveril went in together, and got a good
place close up; which was lucky, for the old church is full
of pillars and angles that obstruct the view. Emma was in
white silk; her bridesmaid, Mary MacEveril, the same; it
was the custom in those days. Tom looked uncommonly
well; but he and she were both nervous. Old Paul gave
her away; and a thin aunt, with a twisted nose, who had
come on a visit to superintend the wedding, in place of
Emma&rsquo;s dead mother, did nothing but weep. She wore an
odd gown, pink one way, blue another; you might have
thought she had borrowed its colours from their copper teakettle.
Mrs. Chandler, Tom&rsquo;s mother, in grey silk, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
smarter than she had ever been in her life; and his aunt,
Mrs. Cramp, was resplendent in a dress bordering upon
orange.</p>

<p>The ceremony came to an end very quickly, I thought&mdash;you
do think so at most simple weddings; and Tom and
his wife went away together in the first carriage. Next came
the breakfast at Mr. Paul&rsquo;s; the aunt presiding in a gentle
stream of tears. Early in the afternoon the bride and bridegroom
left for London, on their way to the Continent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone does not care to dash to a church to see
a marriage: some would as soon think of running to look on
at a funeral. Mr. Preen was one of these insensible people,
and he, of course, did not care to go near it. He made
game of Jane for doing so; but Jane wanted to see the
dresses and the ceremony. Oliver had not the opportunity
of going; and would not have gone though he had had it.
Just about eleven o&rsquo;clock, when the gay doings were in full
swing, Mr. Preen took Oliver off to Worcester in the gig.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before, Mr. Preen had appointed a
saddler in Worcester to be his agent for the new patent
agricultural implements, for which he was himself agent-in-chief.
Until this under agency should be well in hand, Mr.
Preen considered it necessary to see the saddler often: for
which purpose he drove into Worcester at least three times a
week. Once, instead of going himself, he had sent Oliver,
but this day was the first time the two had gone together.
It might have been&mdash;one cannot tell&mdash;but it might have
been that Mr. Preen discerned what this wedding of Emma
Paul&rsquo;s must be to his son, and so took him out to divert his
mind a bit.</p>

<p>Now, upon entering Worcester, to get to the saddler&rsquo;s it
was necessary to drive through High Street and turn into
Broad Street. At least, that was the straightforward route.
But Oliver had not taken it the day he drove in alone; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had preferred the more roundabout way of the back streets.
After driving through Sidbury, he&mdash;instead of going forward
up College Street and so into High Street&mdash;went careering
along Friar Street, along the whole length of New Street,
turned up St. Swithin Street, or Goose Lane, or one of those
dingy thoroughfares, made a dash across the top of High
Street, and so into his destination, Broad Street. In returning
he took the same way. What his objection to the better
streets could be, he alone knew. To-day, however, Mr.
Preen held the reins.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen was driving quietly up College Street, when
Oliver spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d put me down here, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put you down here!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Preen, turning to
look at him. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to get a little book for Jane,&rdquo; answered Oliver,
glancing towards Mr. Eaton&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;I shall be up in
Broad Street nearly as soon as you are, if you want me
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t particularly want you,&rdquo; said Mr. Preen, crustily,
&ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t be long before you come.&rdquo; And, drawing
up to the side, he let Oliver get out.</p>

<p>Driving on to the saddler&rsquo;s, Mr. Preen transacted his
business with him. When it was over, he went to the door,
where his gig waited, and looked up and down the street,
but saw nothing of Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t given himself the trouble to come up! Would
rather put his lazy legs astride one of those posts opposite
the college, and watch for my passing back again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which was of course rather a far-fetched idea of Mr.
Preen&rsquo;s; but he spoke in a temper. Though, indeed, of late
Oliver had appeared singularly inert; as if all spirit to move
had gone out of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen got into his gig at the saddler&rsquo;s door and set
off again. Turning into High Street, he drove gently down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
it, looking out on all sides, if truth must be told, for Oliver.
This caused him to see Stephenson standing at the silversmith&rsquo;s
door, the silversmith himself, back now for good
at his business, being behind the counter. Now and then,
since the bank-note was traced, Mr. Preen had made
inquiries of Stephenson as to whether any news had been
heard of its changer, but he had not done so lately. Not
being in a hurry, he pulled up against the curb-stone.
Stephenson crossed the flags to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing turned up yet, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr. Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can hardly say it has,&rdquo; replied Stephenson;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve seen the gentleman who paid it in to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is it? and where was he?&rdquo; cried Preen,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Stephenson had stepped back a pace, and appeared to be
looking critically at the horse and gig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was last Saturday,&rdquo; he said, coming close again. &ldquo;I
had to take a parcel into Friar Street for one of our country
customers, a farmer&rsquo;s wife who was spending the day with
some people living down there, and I saw a gig bowling
along. The young fellow in it was the one who changed
the note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo; returned Mr. Preen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, sir. I had no opportunity of speaking to
him or stopping him. He was driving at a good pace, and
the moment he caught sight of me, for I saw him do that, he
touched the horse and went on like a whirlwind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Preen&rsquo;s little dark face took a darker frown. &ldquo;<em>I</em>
should have stopped him,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;You ought to
have rushed after him, Stephenson, and called upon the
street to help in the pursuit. You might, at least, have
traced where he went to. A gig, you say he was in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stephenson. &ldquo;And, unless I am greatly
mistaken, it was this very gig you are in now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; retorted Preen, haughtily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I took particular notice of the horse and gig, so as to
recognise them again if ever I got the chance; and I say
that it was this gig and this horse, sir. There&rsquo;s no mistake
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stared into one another&rsquo;s eyes, one face looking up,
and the other looking down. All in a moment, Stephenson
saw the other face turn ghastly white. It had come into
Mr. Preen&rsquo;s recollection amidst his bewilderment, that Oliver
had gone into Worcester last Saturday afternoon, driving the
horse and gig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand this! Who should be in my gig?&rdquo;
he cried, calling some presence of mind to his aid. &ldquo;Last
Saturday, you say? In the afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last Saturday afternoon, close upon four o&rsquo;clock. As I
turned down Lich Street, I saw the lay-clerks coming out of
College. Afternoon service is generally over a little before
four,&rdquo; added Stephenson. &ldquo;He was driving straight into
Friar Street from Sidbury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another recollection flashed across Mr. Preen: Oliver&rsquo;s
asking just now to be put down in College Street. Was it
to prevent his passing through High Street? Was he afraid
to pass through it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a nice-looking young fellow,&rdquo; said Stephenson;
&ldquo;has a fair, mild face; but he was the one who changed the
note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be; but as to his being in my gig, it is
not&mdash;&mdash; Why, I was not in town at all on Saturday,&rdquo;
broke off Mr. Preen, with a show of indignant remonstrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Preen; the young man was in it alone,&rdquo; said
Stephenson, who probably had his own thoughts upon the
problem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t stay longer now; I&rsquo;m late already,&rdquo; said
Mr. Preen. &ldquo;Good morning, Stephenson.&rdquo; And away he
drove with a dash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver was waiting in College Street, standing near the
Hare and Hounds Inn. Mr. Preen pulled up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you did not chose to come on!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I thought there&rsquo;d be hardly time, and I might
miss you; I went to get my hair cut,&rdquo; replied Oliver, as he
settled himself in his place beside his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Preen drove on in silence until they were opposite the
Commandery gates in the lower part of Sidbury. Then he
spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you drive through Friar Street on Saturday
last, instead of going the direct way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through&mdash;Friar Street?&rdquo; stammered Oliver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through Friar Street, instead of High Street,&rdquo; repeated
Mr. Preen, in a sharp, passionate accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember. High Street is so crowded on a
market day; the back streets are quiet,&rdquo; said Oliver, as if he
had a lump in his throat, and could not make his voice
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in taking the back streets you avoid the silversmith&rsquo;s,
and the risk you run of being recognised; is that
it?&rdquo; savagely retorted Mr. Preen.</p>

<p>Not another word did he speak, only drove on home at a
furious pace. Oliver knew all then: the disgrace for which
he had been so long waiting had come upon him.</p>

<p>But when they got indoors, Mr. Preen let loose the vials
of his wrath upon Oliver. Before his mother, before Jane,
he published his iniquity. It was he, Oliver, who had
stolen the ten-pound note; it was he who had so craftily
got it changed at Worcester. Oliver spoke not a word of
denial, made no attempt at excuse or defence; he stood
with bent head and pale, meek face, his blue eyes filled with
utter misery. The same look of misery lay in Mrs. Preen&rsquo;s
eyes as she faintly reproached him amid tears and sobs.
Jane was simply stunned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go away now and hide yourself; I can&rsquo;t keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
you here to be found and pounced upon,&rdquo; roared Mr. Preen.
&ldquo;By the end of the week you must be gone somewhere.
Perhaps you can pick up a living in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will go,&rdquo; said Oliver, meekly. And at the first
lull in the storm he crept up to his room.</p>

<p>He did not come down to dinner; did not come to tea.
Jane carried up a cup of tea upon a waiter and some bread-and-butter,
and put it down outside the chamber door, which
he had bolted.</p>

<p>Later, in passing his room, she saw the door open and
went in. Cup and plate were both empty, so he had taken
the refreshment. He was not in the house, was not in the
garden. Putting on her sun-bonnet and a light shawl, she
ran to the Inlets.</p>

<p>Oliver was there. He sat, gazing moodily at the brook
and the melancholy osier-twigs that grew beside it. Jane
sat down and bent his poor distressed face upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Oliver! Don&rsquo;t take it so to heart. I know you
must have been sorely tempted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bending there upon her, her arms clasping him, yielding
to the loving sympathy, so grateful after those harsh reproaches,
he told her all, under cover of the gathering
shades of evening. Yes, he had been tempted&mdash;and had
yielded to the temptation.</p>

<p>He wanted money badly for necessary things, and things
that he had learned to deem necessaries, and he had it not.
A pair of new gloves now and again, a necktie to replace
his shabby ones, a trifle of loose silver in his pocket. He
owed a small sum to MacEveril, and wanted to repay him.
Once or twice he had asked a little money of his father, and
was refused. His mother would give him a few shillings,
when pressed, but grumbled over it. So Oliver wrote to a
friend at Tours, whom he had known well, asking if he
would lend him some. That was the first week in June.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
His friend wrote back in answer that he could lend him
some after quarter day, the 24th, but not before; he would
send him over ten pounds then, if that would do.</p>

<p>Never a thought had presented itself to Oliver of touching
the ten pounds in his father&rsquo;s letter to Mr. Paul, which he
had sealed and saw posted. But on the following afternoon,
Wednesday, he saw the letter lying on Mr. Hanborough&rsquo;s
desk; the temptation assailed him, and he took it.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Mr. Preen had gone out that
hot day, leaving Oliver a lot of work to do. He got through
it soon after four o&rsquo;clock, and went dashing over the cross
route to Islip and into Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office, for he wanted to
see Dick MacEveril. The office was empty; not a soul
was in it; and as Oliver stood, rather wondering at that
unusual fact, he saw a small pile of letters, evidently just
left by the postman, lying on the desk close to him. The
uppermost of the letters he recognised at once; it was the
one sent by his father. &ldquo;If I might borrow the ten pounds
inside that now, I should be at ease; I would replace it
with the ten pounds coming to me from Tours, and it might
never get known,&rdquo; whispered Satan in his ear, with plausible
cunning.</p>

<p>Never a moment did he allow himself for thought, never
an instant&rsquo;s hesitation served to stop him. Catching up
the letter, he thrust it into his breast pocket, and set off
across country again at a tearing pace, not waiting to see
MacEveril.</p>

<p>He seemed to have flown over hedges and ditches and to
be home in no time. Little wonder that when he was seen
sitting under the walnut tree in the garden and was called in
to tea, his mother and sister exclaimed at his heated face.
They never suspected he had been out.</p>

<p>All that night Oliver lay awake: partly wondering how
he should dispose of his prize to make it available; partly
telling himself, in shame-faced reproach, that he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
use it, but send it back to old Paul. It came into his mind
that if he did use it he might change it at the silversmith&rsquo;s
as if for the Todhetleys, the Squire&rsquo;s name on the back suggesting
the idea to him. It would not do, he thought, to go
into a shop, any shop, purchase some trifling article and
tender a ten-pound note in payment. That might give
rise to suspicion. Some months before, when at Crabb Cot,
he had heard Mrs. Todhetley relate the history of her
brooch, where she bought it, what she paid for it, and all
about it, to Colonel Letsom&rsquo;s wife and other people, for it
happened that several callers had come in together. The
brooch had been passed round the company and admired.
Oliver remembered this, and resolved to make use of it to
disarm suspicion at the silversmith&rsquo;s. He knew the principal
shops in Worcester very well indeed, and Worcester itself.
He had stayed for some time, when sixteen, with an uncle
who was living there; but he had not visited the city since
coming to Duck Brook.</p>

<p>Thursday, the day following that on which he took the
money, was the day of the picnic. Oliver started with Jane
for it in the morning, as may be remembered, the ten-pound
note hidden safely about him. Much to Oliver&rsquo;s surprise
his mother put seven shillings into his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not
want to use it, and must give it me back to-morrow,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but it does not look well to go to a thing of this sort
with quite empty pockets.&rdquo; Oliver thanked her, kissed her,
and they drove off. Before reaching Mrs. Jacob Chandler&rsquo;s,
after passing Islip Grange&mdash;the property of Lady Fontaine,
as may be remembered, who was first cousin to John Paul&mdash;they
overtook Sam, walking on to take back the gig.
&ldquo;We may as well get out here,&rdquo; said Oliver, and he pulled
up. Getting out, and helping out Jane, he sent Sam and
the gig back at once. He bade his sister walk on alone to
Mrs. Chandler&rsquo;s, saying he wanted to do a little errand first.
But he charged her not to mention that; only to say, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
questioned, that he would join them by-and-by. He ran
all the way to the station, regardless of the heat, and caught
a train for Worcester.</p>

<p>The rest is known. Oliver changed the note at the
silversmith&rsquo;s, bought himself a pair of dandy gloves, with
one or two other small matters, and made the best of his
way back again. But it was past the middle of the afternoon
when he got to the picnic: trains do not choose our time
for running, but their own. Jane wondered where he had
been. Hearing of the pigeon-match, she thought it was
there. She asked him, in a whisper, where he had found
those delicate gloves; Oliver laughed and said something
about a last relic from Tours.</p>

<p>And there it was. He had taken the note; he, Oliver
Preen; and got the gold for it. That day of the picnic was
in truth the worst he had ever experienced, the one hard
day of all his life, as he had remarked to Jane. Not only
had he committed a deed in it which might never be
redeemed, but he also learnt that Emma Paul&rsquo;s love was
given not to him, but to another. It was for her sake he
had coveted new gloves and money in his pockets, that he
might not look despicable in her sight.</p>

<p>The dearest and surest of expectations are those that fail.
While Oliver, as the days went on, was feverishly looking
out, morning after morning, for the remittance from Tours,
he received a letter to say it was not coming. His friend,
with many expressions of regret, wrote to the effect that he
was unable to send it at present; later, he hoped to do so.
Of course, it never came. And Oliver had not been able
to replace the money, and&mdash;this was the end of it.</p>

<p>In a whispering, sobbing tone, he told these particulars by
degrees to Jane as they sat there. She tried to comfort
him; said it might never be known beyond themselves at
home; rather advocated his going away for a short time, as
proposed, while things righted themselves, and their father&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
anger cooled down. But Oliver could not be comforted.
Then, leaving the unsatisfactory theme, she tried another,
and began telling him of the wedding at Islip that morning,
and of how Tom and Emma looked&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Jane,&rdquo; he interrupted; and his wailing, shrinking
tone seemed to betray the keenest pain of all.</p>

<p>They walked home together in silence, Jane clinging to
his arm. The night shades lay upon the earth, the stars
were shining in the sky. Oliver laid his hand upon the
garden gate and paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Jane, when I was coming in here for
the first time, how a strange shiver took me, and you thought
I must have caught a chill. It was a warning, my dear; a
warning of the evil that lay in store for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would not go into the parlour to supper, but went
softly up to his room and shut himself in for the night.
Poor Oliver! Poor, poor Oliver!</p>

<p>The following day, Friday, Mr. Preen, allowing himself
the unwonted luxury of a holiday for a day&rsquo;s shooting, was
away betimes. For the afternoon and evening, Mrs. Jacob
Chandler&rsquo;s daughters, Clementina, Georgiana, and Julietta,
had organised a party to celebrate their cousin Tom&rsquo;s
wedding; Miss Julietta called it a &ldquo;flare-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane Preen had promised, for herself and for Oliver, to be
there by three o&rsquo;clock. For Oliver! She made herself
ready after dinner; and then, looking everywhere for her
brother, found him standing in the road just outside the
garden gate. He said he was not going. Jane reproached
him, and he quite laughed at her. <em>He</em> go into company
now! she might know better. But Jane had great influence
over him, and as he walked with her along the road&mdash;for
she was going to walk in and walk back again at night&mdash;she
nearly persuaded him to fetch her. Only nearly; not quite.
Oliver finally refused, and they had almost a quarrel.</p>

<p>Then the tears ran down Jane&rsquo;s cheeks. Her heart was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
aching to pain for him; and her object in pressing him to
come was to take him out of his loneliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this one evening, Oliver!&rdquo; she whispered, clinging
to him and kissing him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you a favour often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Oliver yielded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come for you, Janey,&rdquo; he said,
kissing her in return. &ldquo;That is, I will come on and meet
you; I cannot go to the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, they parted. But in another minute, Jane was
running back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be <em>sure</em> to come, Oliver? You won&rsquo;t disappoint
me? You won&rsquo;t go from your word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver felt a little annoyed; the sore heart grows fretful.
&ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;ll come, then,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you, alive or
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was at the party. Not Tod; he had gone shooting.
We spent the afternoon in the garden. It was not a large
party, after all; only the Letsoms, Jane Preen, and the
Chandler girls; but others were expected later. Jane had a
disconsolate look. Knowing nothing of the trouble at Duck
Brook, I thought she was sad because Valentine had not
come early, according to promise. We knew later that he
had been kept by what he called a long-winded client.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock we went indoors to tea. Those were the
days of real, old-fashioned teas, not sham ones, as now.
Hardly had we seated ourselves round the table, and Mrs.
Jacob Chandler was inquiring who took sugar and who
didn&rsquo;t, when one of the maids came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Miss Preen, the gig is come for you,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gig!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Come for me! You
must be mistaken, Susan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is at the gate, Miss Jane, and Sam&rsquo;s in it. He says
that his master and missus have sent him to take you home
immediate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane, all astonishment, followed by some of us, went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to see what Sam could mean. Sam only repeated in a
stolid kind of way the message he had given to Susan. His
master and mistress had despatched him for Miss Jane and
she must go home at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&mdash;anyone ill?&rdquo; asked Jane,
turning pale.</p>

<p>Sam, looking more stolid than before, professed not to
know anything; he either did not or would not. Miss Jane
had to go, and as quick as she could, was all he would say.</p>

<p>Jane put on her things, said good-bye in haste, and went
out again to the gig. Sam drove off at a tangent before she
had well seated herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Sam, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>Sam, in about three stolid words, protested, as before, he
couldn&rsquo;t say <em>what</em> was the matter; except that he had been
sent off for Miss Jane.</p>

<p>Jane noticed, and thought it odd, that he did not look at her
as he spoke, though he was frank and open by habit; he had
never looked in any of their faces since coming to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Oliver?&rdquo; she asked. But Sam only
muttered that he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; and drove swiftly.</p>

<p>They went on in silence after that, Jane seeing it would
be useless to inquire further, and were soon at Duck Brook.
She felt very uneasy. What she feared was, that her father
and Oliver might have quarrelled, and that the latter was
about to be turned summarily out of doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Mr. Oliver!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Pull up,
Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were passing the first Inlet. Oliver stood at the top
of it, facing the road, evidently looking out for her, as Jane
thought. His gaze was fixed, his face white as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you to pull up, Sam; how dare you disobey me
and drive on in that way?&rdquo; cried Jane; for Sam had whipped
up the horse instead of stopping. Jane, looking at his face
saw it had gone white too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is! there he is again! There&rsquo;s Mr. Oliver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had approached the other Inlet as Jane spoke.
Oliver stood at the top of it, exactly as he had stood at the
other, his gaze fixed on her, his face ghastly. Not a muscle
of his face moved; a dead man could not be more still.
Sam, full of terror, was driving on like lightning, as if some
evil thing were pursuing him.</p>

<p>And now Jane turned pale. What did it mean? these
two appearances? It was totally impossible for Oliver to be
at the last Inlet, if it was he who stood at the other. A bird
of the air might have picked him up, carried him swiftly
over the trees and dropped him at the second Inlet; nothing
else could have done it in the time. What did it mean?</p>

<p>Mr. Preen was waiting at the door to receive Jane. He
came a little way with slow steps down the path to meet her
as the gig stopped. She ran in at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened, papa?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Oliver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver was upstairs, lying upon his bed&mdash;dead. Mr.
Preen disclosed it to her as gently as he knew how.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was all too true. Oliver had died about two hours
before. He had shot himself at the Inlets, close by the
melancholy osiers that grew over the brook.</p>

<p>Oliver had accompanied Jane to the end of Brook Lane.
There, at the Islip Road, they parted; she going on to
Crabb, Oliver walking back again. Upon reaching the
Inlets, that favourite spot of his, he sat down on the bench
that faced the highway; the self-same bench Jane had sat on
when she was watching for his arrival from Tours, in the
early days of spring. He had not sat there above a minute
when he saw his father, with one or two more gentlemen,
get over the gate from the field opposite. They were
returning from shooting, and had their guns in their hands.
Mr. Preen walked quickly over the road to Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my gun indoors,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am not going in
just yet. It is loaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked away down the road with his friends, after
speaking. Oliver took the gun, walked slowly down one of
the Inlets, and placed himself on the nearest bench there,
lodging the gun against the end. In a few minutes there
arose a loud report.</p>

<p>Sam was in the upper part of the field on the other side
the brook with the waggon and waggoner. He turned to
look where the noise came from, and thought he saw some
one lying on the ground by the bench. They both came
round in haste, he and the waggoner, and found Oliver
Preen lying dead with the gun beside him. Running for
assistance, Sam helped to carry him home, and then went
for the nearest doctor; but it was all of no avail. Oliver
was dead.</p>

<p>Was it an accident, or was it intentional? People asked
the question. At the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, Mr. Preen, who
was so affected he could hardly give evidence, said that, so
far as he believed, Oliver was one of the last people likely to
lay violent hands on himself; he was of too calm and gentle
a temperament for that. The rustic jury, pitying the father
and believing him, gave Oliver the benefit of the doubt.
Loaded guns were dangerous, they observed, apt to go off
of themselves almost; and they brought it in Accidental
Death.</p>

<p>But Jane knew better. I thought I knew better. I&rsquo;m
afraid Mr. Preen knew better.</p>

<p>And what of that appearance of Oliver which Jane saw?
It could not have been Oliver in the flesh, but I think it
must have been Oliver in the spirit. Many a time and oft
in the days that followed did Jane recount it over to me; it
seemed a relief to her distress to talk of it. &ldquo;He said he
would come, alive or dead, to meet me; and he came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I, Johnny Ludlow, break off here to state that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
account of this apparition is strictly true. Every minute
particular attending it, even to the gig coming with Sam in
it to fetch Jane from the tea-table, is a faithful record of
that which occurred.</p>

<p>I took an opportunity of questioning Sam, asking whether
he had seen the appearance. It was as we were coming
away from the grave after the funeral. Oliver was buried in
Duck Brook churchyard, close under the clock which had
told him the time when he stood with his father posting the
letters that past afternoon at Dame Sym&rsquo;s window. &ldquo;We
are too late, father,&rdquo; he had said. But for being too late the
tragedy might never have happened, for the letter, which
caused all the trouble and commotion, would have reached
Mr. Paul&rsquo;s hands safely the next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Sam answered me, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I saw
anything. But just as Miss Jane spoke, calling out that
Mr. Oliver was there, a kind of shivering wind seemed to
take me, and I turned icy cold. It was not her words that
could have done it, sir, for I was getting so before she spoke.
And at the last Inlet, when she called it out again, I went
almost out of my mind with cold and terror. The horse was
affrighted too; his coat turned wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was the tragedy: no one can say I did wrong to
call it one. For years and years it has been in my mind to
write it. But I had hoped to end the paper less sadly;
only the story has lengthened itself out, and there&rsquo;s no space
left. I meant to have told of Jane&rsquo;s brighter fate in the
after days with Valentine, the one lover of her life. For
Val pulled himself up from his reckless ways, though not at
Islip; and in a distant land they are now sailing down the
stream of life together, passing through, as we all have to
do, its storms and its sunshine. All this must be left for
another paper.</p>

<h2>IN LATER YEARS</h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>I think it must have been the illness he had in the summer
that tended to finally break down Valentine Chandler. He
had been whirling along all kinds of doubtful ways before,
but when a sort of low fever attacked him, and he had to
lie by for weeks, he was about done for.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how we found it when we got to Crabb Cot in
October. Valentine, what with illness, his wild ways and
his ill-luck, had come to grief and was about to emigrate
to Canada. His once flourishing practice had run away
from him; no prospect seemed left to him in the old
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an awful pity!&rdquo; I remarked to Mrs. Cramp, having
overtaken her in the Islip Road, as she was walking towards
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, it is that, Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; she said, turning her
comely face to me, the strings of her black bonnet tied in
a big bow under her chin. &ldquo;Not much else was to be
expected, taking all things into consideration. George
Chandler, Tom&rsquo;s brother, makes a right good thing of it in
Canada, farming, and Val is going to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hear that Val&rsquo;s mother is leaving North Villa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t afford to stay in it now,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Cramp,
&ldquo;so has let it to the Miss Dennets, and taken a pretty little
place for herself in Crabb. Georgiana has gone out as a
governess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Master Johnny! There are odd moments throughout
all our lives when we have to do things we don&rsquo;t like
any more than we like poison&mdash;I hate to look at the place,&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Cramp, energetically. &ldquo;When I think of Mrs.
Jacob&rsquo;s having to turn out of it, and all through Val&rsquo;s folly,
it gives me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This applied to North Villa, of which we then were
abreast. Mrs. Cramp turned her face from it, and went on
sideways, like a crab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s Jane Preen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was coming along quietly in the afternoon sunshine.
I thought her altered. The once pretty blush-rose of her
dimpled cheeks had faded; in her soft blue eyes, so like
Oliver&rsquo;s, lay a look of sadness. He had been dead about a
year now. But the blush came back again, and the eyes
lighted up with smiles as I took her hand. Mrs. Cramp
went on; she was in a hurry to reach her home, which lay
between Islip and Crabb. Jane rang the bell at North Villa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I take a run over to Duck Brook to-morrow, Jane,
and sit with you in the Inlets, and we&rsquo;ll have a spell of gossip
together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never sit in the Inlets now,&rdquo; she said, in a half whisper,
turning her face away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Jane,&rdquo; I cried, repenting my thoughtlessness;
and she disappeared up the garden path.</p>

<p>Susan opened the door. Her mistress was out, she said,
but Miss Clementina was at home. It was Clementina that
Jane wanted to see.</p>

<p>Valentine, still weak, was lying on the sofa in the parlour
when Jane entered. He got up, all excitement at seeing
her, and they sat down together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought this for Clementina,&rdquo; she said, placing a paper
parcel on the table. &ldquo;It is a pattern which she asked me
for. Are you growing stronger?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Clementina is about somewhere,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;the
others are out. Yes, I am growing stronger; but it seems
to me that I am a long while about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat on in silence, side by side, neither speaking.
Valentine took Jane&rsquo;s hand and held it within his own, which
rested on his knee. It seemed that they had lost their
tongues&mdash;as we say to the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it all decided?&rdquo; asked Jane presently. &ldquo;Quite
decided?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite, Jane. Nothing else is left for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught her breath with one of those long sighs that
tell of inward tribulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have been over to see you before this, Jane, but
that my legs would not carry me to Duck Brook and back
again without sitting down by the wayside. And you&mdash;you
hardly ever come here now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A deep flush passed swiftly over Jane&rsquo;s face. She had
not liked to call at the troubled house. And she very
rarely came so far as Crabb now: there seemed to be no
plea for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will be the end, Val?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Valentine groaned. &ldquo;I try not to think of it, my dear.
When I cannot put all thought of the future from me, it
gives me more torment than I know how to bear. If
only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened, and in came Clementina, arresting what
he had been about to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the pattern you asked me for, Clementina,&rdquo; Jane
said, rising to depart on her return home. For she would
not risk passing the Inlets after sunset.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A week or two went by, and the time of Valentine
Chandler&rsquo;s departure arrived. He had grown well and
strong apparently, and went about to say Good-bye to
people in a subdued fashion. The Squire took him apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
when Val came for that purpose to us, and talked to him in
private. Tod called it a &ldquo;Curtain Lecture.&rdquo; Valentine
was to leave Crabb at daybreak on the Saturday morning
for London, and go at once on board the ship lying in the
docks about to steam away for Quebec.</p>

<p>It perhaps surprised none of us who knew the Chandler
girls that they should be seen tearing over the parish on the
Friday afternoon to invite people to tea. &ldquo;It will be
miserably dull this last evening, you know, Johnny,&rdquo; they
said to me in their flying visit; &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t stand it alone.
Be sure to come in early: and leave word that Joseph
Todhetley is to join us as soon as he gets back again.&rdquo; For
Tod had gone out.</p>

<p>According to orders, I was at North Villa betimes: and,
just as on that other afternoon, I met Jane Preen at the
gate. She had walked in from Duck Brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to spend the evening here, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the last evening,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Valentine
wished it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girls have been to invite me; wouldn&rsquo;t let me say
No. There&rsquo;s to be quite a party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A party!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they could manage to get one up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure Valentine did not know that this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay not. I asked the girls if Valentine wanted a
crowd there on his last evening, and they exclaimed that
Valentine never knew what was good for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are here, Johnny,&rdquo; she went on, after a silence,
&ldquo;I wonder if you would mind my asking you to do me a
favour? It is to walk home with me after tea. I shall not
be late this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>cannot</em> go past the Inlets alone after dark,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;I never do so by daylight but a dreadful
shiver seizes me. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid of seeing something.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen it since that first evening, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never since. Never once. I do not suppose that I
shall ever see it again; but the fear lies upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went on to explain that the gig could not be sent
for her that evening, as Mr. Preen had gone to Alcester in
it and taken Sam. Her mode and voice seemed strangely
subdued, as if all spirit had left her for ever.</p>

<p>In spite of their efforts, the Miss Chandlers met with
little luck. One of the Letsom girls and Tom Coney were
all the recruits they were able to pick up. They came
dashing in close upon our heels. In the hall stood Valentine&rsquo;s
luggage locked and corded, ready for conveyance
to the station.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much to relate of that evening: I hardly
know why I allude to it at all&mdash;only that these painful
records sometimes bring a sad sort of soothing to the weary
heart, causing it to look forward to that other life where will
be no sorrow and no parting.</p>

<p>Tod came in after tea. He and Coney kept the girls
alive, if one might judge by the laughter that echoed from
the other room. Tea remained on the table for anyone
else who might arrive, but Mrs. Jacob Chandler had turned
from it to put her feet on the fender. She kept me by her,
asking about a slight accident which had happened to one
of our servants. Valentine and Jane were standing at the
doors of the open window in silence, as if they wanted to
take in a view of the garden. And that state of things
continued, as it seemed to me, for a good half-hour.</p>

<p>It was a wild night, but very warm for November. White
clouds scudded across the face of the sky; moonlight
streamed into the room. The fire was low, and the green
shade had been placed over the lamp, so that there seemed
to be no light but that of the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing a song for the last time, Valentine?&rdquo; I
heard Jane ask him with half a sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-night; I&rsquo;m not equal to it. But, yes, I will;
one song,&rdquo; he added, turning round. &ldquo;Night and day that
one song has been ever haunting me, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was sitting down to the piano when Mrs. Cramp
came in. She said she would go up to take her bonnet off,
and Mrs. Chandler went with her. This left me alone at
the fire. I should have made a start for the next room
where the laughing was, but that I did not like to disturb the
song then begun. Jane stood listening just outside the open
window, her hands covering her bent face.</p>

<p>Whether the circumstances and surroundings made an
undue impression on me, I know not, but the song struck
me as being the most plaintive one I had ever heard and
singularly appropriate to that present hour. The singer was
departing beyond seas, leaving one he loved hopelessly
behind him.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Remember me, though rolling ocean place its bounds &rsquo;twixt thee and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember me with fond emotion, and believe I&rsquo;ll think of thee.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>So it began; and I wish I could recollect how it went on,
but I can&rsquo;t; only a line here and there. I think it was set
to the tune of Weber&rsquo;s Last Waltz, but I&rsquo;m not sure. There
came a line, &ldquo;My lingering look from thine will sever only
with an aching heart;&rdquo; there came another bit towards the
end: &ldquo;But fail not to remember me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing in themselves, you will say, these lines; their
charm lay in the singing. To listen to their mournful
pathos brought with it a strange intensity of pain. Valentine
sang them as very few can sing. That his heart was
aching, aching with a bitterness which can never be pictured
except by those who have felt it; that Jane&rsquo;s heart was
aching as she listened, was all too evident. You could feel
the anguish of their souls. It was in truth a ballad
singularly applicable to the time and place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The song ceased; the music died away. Jane moved
from the piano with a sob that could no longer be suppressed.
Valentine sat still and motionless. As to me, I
made a quiet glide of it into the other room, just as Mrs.
Cramp and Mrs. Jacob Chandler were coming in for some
tea. Julietta seized me on one side and Fanny Letsom on
the other; they were going in for forfeits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Valentine Chandler left the piano and went out, looking
for Jane. Not seeing her, he followed on down the garden
path, treading on its dry, dead leaves. The wind, sighing
and moaning, played amidst the branches of the trees,
nearly bare now; every other minute the moon was obscured
by the flying clouds. Warm though the night was, and
grand in its aspect, signs might be detected of the approaching
winter.</p>

<p>Jane Preen was standing near the old garden arbour,
from which could be seen by daylight the long chain of the
Malvern Hills. Valentine drew Jane within, and seated her
by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our last meeting; our last parting, Jane!&rdquo; he whispered
from the depth of his full heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it be for ever?&rdquo; she wailed.</p>

<p>He took time to answer. &ldquo;I would willingly say No;
I would <em>promise</em> it to you, Jane, but that I doubt myself. I
know that it lies with me; and I know that if God will help
me, I may be able to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke down. He could not go on. Jane bent her head
towards him. Drawing it to his shoulder, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been able to pull up here, despite the resolutions
I have made from time to time. I was one of a fast
set of men at Islip, and&mdash;somehow&mdash;they were stronger than
I was. In Canada it may be different. I promise you, my
darling, that I will strive to make it so. Do you think this
is no lesson to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If not, we may never see each other again in this
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Valentine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only in Heaven. The mistakes we make here may be
righted there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will it be <em>nothing</em> to you, never to see me again
here?&mdash;no sorrow or pain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No sorrow or pain!</em>&rdquo; Valentine echoed the words out
of the very depths of woe. Even then the pain within him
was almost greater than he could bear.</p>

<p>They sat on in silence, with their aching hearts. Words
fail in an hour of anguish such as this. An hour that comes
perhaps but once in a lifetime; to some of us, never. Jane&rsquo;s
face lay nestled against his shoulder; her hand was in his
clasp. Val&rsquo;s tears were falling; he was weak yet from his
recent illness; Jane&rsquo;s despair was beyond tears.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were in the height and swing of forfeits when
Valentine and Jane came in. They could not remain in
the arbour all night, you see, romantic and lovely though it
might be to sit in the moonlight. Jane said she must be
going home; her mother had charged her not to be late.</p>

<p>When she came down with her things on, I, remembering
what she had asked me, took my hat and waited for her in
the hall. But Valentine came out with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you all the same, Johnny,&rdquo; she said to me. And
I went back to the forfeits.</p>

<p>They went off together, Jane&rsquo;s arm within his&mdash;their last
walk, perhaps, in this world. But it seemed that they could
not talk any more than they did in the garden, and went
along for the most part in silence. Just before turning into
Brook Lane they met Tom Chandler&mdash;he who was doing so
much for Valentine in this emigration matter. He had
come from Islip to spend a last hour with his cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Tom; you&rsquo;ll find them all at home,&rdquo; said
Valentine. &ldquo;I shall not be very long after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon coming to the Inlets, Jane clung closer to
Valentine&rsquo;s arm. It was here that she had seen her unfortunate
brother Oliver standing, after his death. Valentine
hastily passed his arm round her to impart a sense
of protection.</p>

<p>At the gate they parted, taking their farewell hand-shake,
their last kiss. &ldquo;God help you, my dear!&rdquo; breathed
Valentine. &ldquo;And if&mdash;if we never meet again, believe that
no other will ever love you as I have loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned back on the road he had come, and Jane went
in to her desolate home.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mary Ann, I&rsquo;ve come back, and brought a visitor
with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary Ann Cramp, superintending the preserving of a
pan of morella cherries over the fire in her spacious kitchen,
turned round in surprise. I was perched on the arm of the
old oak chair, watching the process. I had gone to the
farm with a message from Crabb Cot, and Mrs. Cramp,
ignoring ceremony, called me into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Standing at the door, with the above announcement, was
Julietta Chandler. She had been away on a fortnight&rsquo;s
visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now where on earth did you spring from, Juliet?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Cramp. &ldquo;I did not expect you to-day. A
visitor? Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cherry Dawson, Aunt Mary Ann; and I didn&rsquo;t think it
mattered about letting you know,&rdquo; returned Juliet. They
had given up the longer name, Julietta. &ldquo;You can see her
if you look through the window; she is getting out of the fly
at the gate. Cherry Dawson is the nicest and jolliest girl in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the world, and you&rsquo;ll all be in love with her&mdash;including you,
Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, there she was, springing from the fly which
had brought them from Crabb station. A light, airy figure
in a fresh brown-holland dress and flapping Leghorn hat.
The kitchen window was open, and we could hear her voice
all that way off, laughing loudly at something and chattering
to the driver. She was very fair, with pretty white teeth,
and a pink colour on her saucy face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cramp left Sally to the cherries, went to the hall
door and opened it herself, calling the other maid, Joan, to
come down. The visitor flew in with a run and a sparkling
laugh, and at once kissed Mrs. Cramp on both cheeks, without
saying with your leave or by your leave. I think she
would not have minded kissing me, for she came dancing
up and shook my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Johnny Ludlow, Cherry,&rdquo; said Juliet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how delightful!&rdquo; cried Miss Cherry.</p>

<p>She was really very unsophisticated; or&mdash;very much the
other way. One cannot quite tell at a first moment. But,
let her be which she might, there was one thing about her
that took the eyes by storm. It was her hair.</p>

<p>Whether her rapid movements had unfastened it, or
whether she wore it so, I knew not, but it fell on her
shoulders like a shower of gold. Her small face seemed to
be set in an amber aureole. I had never before seen hair
so absolutely resembling the colour of pure gold. As she
ran back to Mrs. Cramp from me, it glittered in the sunlight.
The shower of gold in which Jupiter went courting Danaë
could hardly have been more seductive than this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t mind my coming uninvited, you dear
Mrs. Cramp!&rdquo; she exclaimed joyously. &ldquo;I did so want to
make your acquaintance. And Clementina was growing
such a cross-patch. It&rsquo;s not Tim&rsquo;s fault if he can&rsquo;t come
back yet. Is it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know anything about it,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Cramp,
apparently not quite sure what to make of her.</p>

<p>With this additional company I thought it well to come
away, and wished them good morning. At the gate stood
the fly still, the horse resting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like to take a lift, Mr. Johnny, as far as your place?&rdquo;
asked the man civilly. &ldquo;I am just starting back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Lease,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I am going
across to Duck Brook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious young party that, ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo; said Lease,
pointing the whip over his shoulder towards the house.
&ldquo;She went and asked me if Mrs. Cramp warn&rsquo;t an old
Image, born in the year One, and didn&rsquo;t she get her gowns
out of Noah&rsquo;s Ark? And while I was staring at her saying
that, she went off into shouts of laughter enough to frighten
the horse. Did you see her hair, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part, I don&rsquo;t favour that bright yaller for hair,
Mr. Johnny. I never knew but one woman have such, and
she was more deceitful than a she-fox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lease touched his hat and drove off. He was cousin in
a remote degree to poor Maria Lease, and to Lease the
pointsman who had caused the accident to the train at
Crabb junction and died of the trouble. At that moment,
Fred Scott came up; a short, dark young fellow, with fierce
black whiskers, good-natured and rather soft. He was
fond of playing billiards at the Bell at Islip; had been doing
it for some years now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Ludlow, has that fly come with Juliet Chandler?
Is she back again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just come. She has brought some one with her: a girl
with golden hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother <em>her</em>!&rdquo; returned Fred. &ldquo;But it has been as
dull as ditchwater without Juliet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dashed in at Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s gate and up the winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
path. I turned into the Islip Road, and crossed it to take
Brook Lane. The leaves were beginning to put on the tints
of autumn; the grain was nearly all gathered.</p>

<p>Time the healer! As Mrs. Todhetley says, it may well
be called so. Heaven in mercy sends it to the sick and
heavy-laden with healing on its wings. Nearly three years
had slipped by since the departure for Canada of Valentine
Chandler; four years since the tragic death of Oliver
Preen.</p>

<p>There are few changes to record. Things and people
were for the most part going on as they had done. It was
reported that Valentine had turned over a new leaf from the
hour he landed over yonder, becoming thoroughly staid and
steady. Early in the summer of this year his mother had
shut up her cottage at North Crabb to go to Guernsey, on
the invitation of a sister from whom she had expectations.
Upon this, Julietta, who lived with her mother, went on a
long visit to Mrs. Cramp.</p>

<p>Clementina had married. Her husband was a Mr.
Timothy Dawson, junior partner in a wholesale firm of
general merchants in Birmingham; they had also a house
in New York. Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Dawson lived in a
white villa at Edgbaston, and went in for style and fashion.
At least she did, which might go without telling. The
family in which her sister Georgiana was governess occupied
another white villa hard by.</p>

<p>Close upon Juliet&rsquo;s thus taking up her residence with her
aunt, finding perhaps the farm rather dull, she struck up
a flirtation with Fred Scott, or he with her. They were
everlastingly together, mooning about Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s grounds,
or sauntering up and down the Islip Road. Juliet gave out
that they were engaged. No one believed it. At present
Fred had nothing to marry upon: his mother, just about as
soft as himself, supplied him with as much pocket-money as
he asked for, and there his funds ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Juliet had now returned from a week or two&rsquo;s visit she
had been paying Clementina, bringing with her, uninvited,
the young lady with the golden hair. That hair seemed to
be before my eyes as a picture as I walked along. She was
Timothy Dawson&rsquo;s young half-sister. Both the girls had
grown tired of staying with Clementina, who worried herself
and everyone about her just now because her husband
was detained longer than he had anticipated in New York,
whither he had gone on business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Frederick Scott had said &ldquo;Bother&rdquo; in contempt
when he first heard of the visitor with the golden hair. He
did not say it long. Miss Cherry Dawson cast a spell upon
him. He had never met such a rattling, laughing girl in all
his born days, which was how he phrased it; had never
seen such bewildering hair. Cherry fascinated him. Forgetting
his allegiance to Juliet, faithless swain that he was,
he went right over to the enemy. Miss Cherry, nothing
loth, accepted his homage openly, and enjoyed the raging
jealousy of Juliet.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, Juliet received a telegram from
Edgbaston. Her sister Clementina was taken suddenly ill
and wanted her. She must take the first train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are coming with me, Cherry!&rdquo; said
Juliet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am not,&rdquo; laughed Cherry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy
here&mdash;if dear Mrs. Cramp will let me stay with her. You&rsquo;ll
be back again in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not seeing any polite way of sending her away in the face
of this, Mrs. Cramp let her stay on. Juliet was away a
week&mdash;and a nice time the other one and Fred had of it,
improving the shining hours with soft speeches and love-making.
When Juliet got back again, she felt ready to
turn herself into a female Bluebeard, and cut off Cherry&rsquo;s
golden head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Close upon that Mrs. Cramp held her harvest-home.
&ldquo;You may as well come early, and we&rsquo;ll have tea on the
lawn,&rdquo; she said, when inviting us.</p>

<p>It was a fine afternoon, warm as summer, though
September was drawing to its close. Many of the old
friends you have heard of were there. Mary MacEveril
and her cousin Dick, who seemed to be carrying on a little
with one another, as Tod called it; the Letsoms, boys and
girls; Emma Chandler, who looked younger than ever,
though she could boast of two babies: and others. Jane
Preen was there, the weary look which her mild and pretty
face had gained latterly very plainly to be seen. We roamed
at will about the grounds, and had tea under the large
weeping elm tree. Altogether the gathering brought forcibly
to mind that other gathering; that of the picnic, four
summers ago, when we had sung songs in light-hearted glee,
and poor Oliver Preen must have been ready to die of
mortal pain.</p>

<p>The element of interest to-day lay in Miss Cherry
Dawson. In her undisguised assumption of ownership in
Fred Scott, and in Juliet Chandler&rsquo;s rampant jealousy of the
pair. You should have seen the girl flitting about like a
fairy, in her white muslin frock, the golden shower of curls
falling around her like nothing but threads of transparent
amber. Fred was evidently very far gone. Juliet wore
white also.</p>

<p>Whether things would have come that evening to the
startling pass they did but for an unfortunate remark made
in thoughtless fun, not in malice, I cannot tell. It gave
a sting to Juliet that she could not bear. A ridiculous
pastime was going on. Some of them were holding hands
in a circle and dancing round to the &ldquo;House that Jack
Built,&rdquo; each one reciting a sentence in turn. If you forgot
your sentence, you paid a forfeit. The one falling to Juliet
Chandler was &ldquo;This the maiden all forlorn.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
exactly what you are, Juliet!&rdquo; cried Tom Coney, impulsively,
and a laugh went round. Juliet said nothing, but I saw her
face change to the hue of death. The golden hair of the
other damsel was gleaming just then within view amidst the
trees, accompanied by the black head and black whiskers of
Mr. Fred Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young man must have a rare time of it between the
two,&rdquo; whispered Tod to me. &ldquo;As good as the ass between
the bundles of hay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dusk began the fun of the harvest-home. Mrs.
Cramp&rsquo;s labourers and their wives sat in the large kitchen
at an abundant board. Hot beef, mutton and hams
crowded it, with vegetables; and of fruit pies and tarts
there was a goodly show. Some of us helped to wait on
them, and that was the best fun of all.</p>

<p>They had all taken as much as they could possibly eat,
and were in the full flow of cider and beer and delight; a
young man in a clean white smock-frock was sheepishly
indulging the table with a song: &ldquo;Young Roger of the
Valley,&rdquo; and I was laughing till I had to hold my sides;
when Mrs. Cramp touched me on the back. She sat with
the Miss Dennets in the little parlour off the kitchen, in
full view of the company. I sat on the door-sill between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Juliet and Cherry
Dawson. Have they been in at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not remember to have seen them; or Fred Scott
either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just go out and look for the two girls, will you, Johnny.
It&rsquo;s too late for them to be out, though it is a warm night.
Tell them I say they are to come in at once,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Cramp.</p>

<p>Not half a stone&rsquo;s throw from the house I found them&mdash;quarrelling.
Their noisy voices guided me. A brilliant
moon lighted up the scene. The young ladies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
taunting one another; Juliet in frantic passion; Cherry in
sarcastic mockery. Fred Scott, after trying in vain to throw
oil upon the troubled waters, had given it up as hopeless,
and stood leaning against a tree in silent patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; Cherry was saying tauntingly when I
got up. &ldquo;We <em>are</em> engaged. We shall be married shortly.
Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not,&rdquo; raved Juliet, her voice trembling with the
intense rage she was in. &ldquo;He was engaged to me before
you came here; he is engaged to me still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cherry laughed out in mockery. &ldquo;Dear me! old maids
do deceive themselves so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very hard, that, and Juliet winced. She was five or six
years older than the fairy. How Fred relished the bringing
home to him of his sins, I leave you to judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, can&rsquo;t you have done with this, you silly girls?&rdquo;
he cried out meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a short time you&rsquo;ll have our wedding-cards,&rdquo; went on
Cherry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all arranged. He&rsquo;s only waiting for me to
decide whether it shall take place here or at Gretna Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Juliet dashed round to face Fred Scott. &ldquo;If this be
true; if you do behave in this false way to me, I&rsquo;ll not
survive it,&rdquo; she said, hardly able to bring the words out in
her storm of passion. &ldquo;Do you hear me? I&rsquo;ll not live to
see it, I say; and my ghost shall haunt her for her whole
life after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, easy, Juliet,&rdquo; pleaded Fred uncomfortably.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is; I think she is saying this to aggravate me,&rdquo;
assented Juliet, subsiding to a sort of calmness. &ldquo;If not,
take you warning, Cherry Dawson, for I&rsquo;ll keep my word.
My apparition shall haunt you for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had better begin to-night, then, for you&rsquo;ll soon find
out that it&rsquo;s as true as gospel,&rdquo; retorted Cherry.</p>

<p>Managing at last to get in a word, I delivered Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Cramp&rsquo;s message: they were to come in instantly. Fred
obeyed it with immense relief and ran in before me. The
two girls would follow, I concluded, when their jarring had
spent itself. The last glimpse I had of them, they were
stretching out their faces at each other like a couple of
storks. Juliet&rsquo;s straw hat had fallen from her head and was
hanging by its strings round her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; spoke up Fred, in answer to Mrs.
Cramp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice out there; the moon&rsquo;s bright as
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And presently I heard the laugh of Cherry Dawson
amidst us. Her golden hair, her scarlet cheeks and her
blue eyes were all sparkling together.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was the next morning. We were at breakfast, answering
Mr. and Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s questions about the harvest home,
when old Thomas came in, all sad and scared, to tell some
news. Juliet Chandler was dead: she had destroyed herself.</p>

<p>Of course the Squire at once attacked Thomas for saying
it. But a sick feeling of conviction arose within me that it
was true. One of the servants, out of doors on an errand,
had heard it from a man in the road. The Squire sat
rubbing his face, which had turned hot.</p>

<p>Leaving the breakfast table, I started for Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s.
Miss Susan Dennet was standing at her gate, her white
handkerchief thrown over her head, her pale face limp with
fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she called to me, &ldquo;have you heard? Do you
think it can be true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope not, Miss Susan. I am now going there
to see. What I&rsquo;m thinking of is this&mdash;if it is not true, how
can such a report have arisen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod caught me up, and we found the farm in distress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
commotion. It was all true; and poor Mrs. Cramp was
almost dumb with dismay. These were the particulars:
The previous evening, Juliet did not appear at the late
supper, laid in the dining-room for the guests; at least, no
one remembered to have seen her. Later, when the guests
had left, and Mrs. Cramp was in the kitchen busy with her
maids, Cherry Dawson looked in, bed-candle in hand, to
say good-night. &ldquo;I suppose Juliet is going up with you,&rdquo;
remarked Mrs. Cramp. &ldquo;Oh, Juliet went up ages ago,&rdquo;
said Cherry, in answer.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly. Early in the morning one of
the farm men went to the eel-pond to put in a net, and saw
some clothes lying on the brink. Rushing indoors, he
brought out Sally. She knew the things at once. There
lay the white dress and the pink ribbons which Juliet had
worn the night before; the straw hat, and a small fleecy
handkerchief which she had tied round her neck at sundown.
Pinned to the sash and the dress was a piece of paper on
which was written in ink, in a large hand&mdash;Juliet&rsquo;s hand:</p>

<p class="smcap">&ldquo;I said I would do it; and I will haunt her
for evermore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course she had taken these things off and left them on
the bank, with the memorandum pinned to them, to make
known that she had flung herself into the pond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely believe it; it seems so incredible,&rdquo; sighed
poor Mrs. Cramp, to the Squire, who had come bustling in.
&ldquo;Juliet, as I should have thought, was one of the very last
girls to do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next to appear upon the scene, puffing and panting
with agitation, was Fred Scott. He asked which of the two
girls it was, having heard only a garbled account; and now
learned that it was Juliet. As to Cherry Dawson, she was
shut up in her bedroom in shrieking hysterics. Men were
preparing to drag the pond in search of&mdash;&mdash;well, what was
lying there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The pond was at the end of the garden, near the fence
that divided it from the three-acre field. Nothing had been
disturbed. The white frock and pink ribbons were lying
with the paper pinned to them; the hat was close by. A
yard off was the white woollen handkerchief; and near it
I saw the faded bunch of mignonette which Juliet had worn
in her waistband. It looked as if she had flung the things
off in desperation.</p>

<p>Standing later in the large parlour, listening to comments
and opinions, one question troubled me&mdash;Ought I to tell
what I knew of the quarrel? It might look like treachery
towards Scott and the girl upstairs; but, should that poor
dead Juliet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The doubt was suddenly solved for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want to get at is this,&rdquo; urged the Squire: &ldquo;did
anything happen to drive her to this? One doesn&rsquo;t throw
oneself into an eel-pond for nothing in one&rsquo;s sober senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Juliet and Miss Dawson had a quarrel out o&rsquo; doors
last night,&rdquo; struck in Joan, for the two servants were assisting
at the conference. &ldquo;Sally heard &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cramp. &ldquo;Speak up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Sally, coming forward.
&ldquo;I went out to shake a tray-cloth, and heard voices at
a distance, all in a rage like; so I just stepped on a bit to
see what it meant. The two young lasses was snarling at
one another like anything. Miss Juliet was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were they quarrelling about?&rdquo; interrupted the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it seemed to be about Mr. Scott&mdash;which of
&rsquo;em had him for a sweetheart, and which of &rsquo;em hadn&rsquo;t.
Mr. Johnny Ludlow ran up as I came in: perhaps he heard
more than I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, there was nothing for it but to let the past
scene come out; and Mrs. Cramp had the pleasure of
being enlightened as to the rivalry which had been going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
under her roof and the ill-feeling which had arisen out of it.
Fred Scott, to do him justice, spoke up like a man, not
denying the flirtation he had carried on, first with Juliet,
next with Cherry, but he declared most positively that it
had never been serious on any side.</p>

<p>The Squire wheeled round. &ldquo;Just say what you mean
by that, Mr. Frederick. What do you call serious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said a word to either of them which could
suggest serious intentions, sir. I never hinted at such a
thing as getting married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here, young man,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cramp, taking
her handkerchief from her troubled face, &ldquo;what right had
you to do that? By what right did you play upon those
young girls with your silly speeches and your flirting ways,
if you meant nothing?&mdash;nothing to either of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Scott, eating humble
pie; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it for the world had I foreseen
this. It was just a bit of flirting and nothing else. And
neither of them ever thought it was anything else; they
knew better; only they became snappish with one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not think you meant marrying?&rdquo; cried the Squire
sarcastically, fixing Scott with his spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, sir. Why, how could I mean it?&rdquo; went on
Scott in his simple way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no money, while my mother
lives, to set up a wife or a house; she wouldn&rsquo;t let me. I
joked and laughed with the two girls, and they joked and
laughed back again. I don&rsquo;t care what they may have said
between themselves&mdash;they <em>knew</em> there was nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scott was right, so far. All the world, including the
Chandlers and poor Juliet, knew that Scott was no more
likely to marry than the man in the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you could stand by quietly last night when they
were having, it seems, this bitter quarrel, and not stop it?&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Cramp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would not listen to me,&rdquo; returned Scott. &ldquo;I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
between them; spoke to one, spoke to the other; told them
what they were quarrelling about was utter nonsense&mdash;and
the more I said, the more they wrangled. Johnny Ludlow
saw how it was; he came up at the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cherry Dawson was sent for downstairs, and came in
between Sally and Joan, limp and tearful and shaking with
fright. Mrs. Cramp questioned her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all done in fun,&rdquo; she said with a sob. &ldquo;Juliet
and I teased one another. It was as much her fault as
mine. Fred Scott needn&rsquo;t talk. I&rsquo;m sure <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t want
him. I&rsquo;ve somebody waiting for me at Edgbaston, if I
choose. Scott may go to York!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you mind your manners, young woman: you&rsquo;ve
done enough mischief in my house without forgetting <em>them</em>,&rdquo;
reproved Mrs. Cramp. &ldquo;I want to know when you last
saw Juliet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came in together after the quarrel. She ran up to
her room; I joined the rest of you. As she did not come
down to supper, I thought she had gone to bed. O-o-o-o-o!&rdquo;
shivered Cherry; &ldquo;and she says she&rsquo;ll haunt me! I shall
never dare to be alone in the dark again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Scott took his departure, glad no doubt to do
so, carrying with him a hint from Mrs. Cramp that for the
present his visits must cease, unless he should be required
to give evidence at the inquest. As he went out, Mr. Paul
and Tom Chandler came in together. Tom, strong in
plain common-sense, could not at all understand it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Passion must have overbalanced her reason and driven
her mad,&rdquo; he said aside to me. &ldquo;The taunts of that
Dawson girl did it, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blighted love,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moonshine,&rdquo; answered Tom Chandler. &ldquo;Juliet, poor
girl, had gone in for too many flirtations to care much for
Scott. As to that golden-haired one, <em>her</em> life is passed in
nothing else: getting out of one love affair into another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
month in, month out. Her brother Tim once told her so
in my presence. No, Johnny, it is a terrible calamity, but
I shall never understand how she came to do it as long as
I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not sure that I should. Juliet was very practical:
not one of your moaning, sighing, die-away sort of girls who
lose their brains for love, like crazy Jane. It was a dreadful
thing, whatever might have been the cause, and we were all
sorry for Mrs. Cramp. Nothing had stirred us like this
since the death of Oliver Preen.</p>

<p>Georgiana Chandler came flying over from Birmingham
in a state of excitement. Cherry Dawson had gone then,
or Georgie might have shaken her to pieces. When put up,
Georgie had a temper of her own. Cherry had disappeared
into the wilds of Devonshire, where her home was, and
where she most devoutly hoped Juliet&rsquo;s ghost would not
find its way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an awful thing to have taken place in your house,
Aunt Mary Ann. And why unhappy, ill-fated Juliet should
have&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t talk of it,&rdquo; broke off Georgie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that I am ashamed of its having happened here,
Georgiana,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Cramp. &ldquo;I am not alluding
to the sad termination, but to that parcel of nonsense, the
sweethearting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clementina is more heartless than an owl over it,&rdquo;
continued Georgie, making her remarks. &ldquo;She says it
serves Juliet right for her flirting folly, and she hopes
Cherry will be haunted till her yellow curls turn grey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The more they dragged, the less chance there seemed of
finding Juliet. Nothing came up but eels. It was known
that the eel-pond had a hole or two in it which no drags
could penetrate. Gloom settled down upon us all. Mrs.
Cramp&rsquo;s healthy cheeks lost some of their redness. One
day, calling at Crabb Cot, she privately told us that the
trouble would lie upon her for ever. The best word Tod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
gave to it was&mdash;that he would go a day&rsquo;s march with peas
in his shoes to see a certain lady hanging by her golden
hair on a sour apple tree.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a bleak October evening. Jane Preen, in her old
shawl and garden hat, was hurrying to Dame Sym&rsquo;s on an
errand for her mother. The cold wind sighed and moaned
in the trees, clouds flitted across the face of the crescent
moon. It scarcely lighted up the little old church beyond
the Triangle, and the graves in the churchyard beneath,
Oliver&rsquo;s amidst them. Jane shivered, and ran into Mrs. Sym&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Carrying back her parcel, she turned in at the garden
gate and stood leaning over it for a few moments. Tears
were coursing down her cheeks. Life for a long time had
seemed very hard to Jane; no hope anywhere.</p>

<p>The sound of quick footsteps broke upon her ear, and
a gentleman came into view. She rather wondered who it
was; whether anyone was coming to call on her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane! Jane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a faint cry, she fell into the arms opened to receive
her&mdash;those of Valentine Chandler. He went away, a
ne&rsquo;er-do-well, three years ago, shattered in health, shaken
in spirit; he had returned a healthy, hearty man, all his
parts about him.</p>

<p>Yes, Valentine had turned over a new leaf from the
moment he touched the Canadian shores. He had put
his shoulder to the wheel in earnest, had persevered and
prospered. And now he had a profitable farm of his own,
and a pretty house upon it, all in readiness for Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have heard from time to time that you were doing
well,&rdquo; she said, with a sob of joy. &ldquo;Oh, Valentine, how
good it is! To have done it all yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not altogether myself, Jane,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I did my
best, and God sent His blessing upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane no longer felt the night cold, the wind bleak, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
remembered that her mother was waiting for the parcel.
They paced the old wilderness of a garden, arm locked
within arm. There was something in the windy night to
put them in mind of that other night: the night of their
parting, when Valentine had sung his song of farewell, and
bade her remember him though rolling ocean placed its
bounds between them. They had been faithful to one
another.</p>

<p>Seated on the bench, under the walnut tree, the very spot
on which poor Oliver had sat after that rush home from his
fatal visit to Mr. Paul&rsquo;s office at Islip, Jane ventured to
say a word about Juliet, and, to her surprise, found that
Valentine knew nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not heard any news yet, Jane,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
came straight to you from the station. Presently I shall
go back to astonish Aunt Mary Ann. Why? What about
Juliet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane enlightened him by degrees, giving him one particular
after another. Valentine listening in silence to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a syllable of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do you mean? What don&rsquo;t you believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Juliet threw herself into the pond. My dear, she
is not the kind of girl to do it; she&rsquo;d no more do such
a thing than I should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Val! It is true the drags brought up nothing but
eels; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s nothing but eels there
to bring up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where can Juliet be?&mdash;what is the mystery?&rdquo;
dissented Jane. &ldquo;What became of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know. Rely upon it, Janey, she is not
there. She&rsquo;d never jump into that cold pond. How long
ago is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly a month. Three weeks last Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see if I can get to the
bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Showing himself indoors to Mr. and Mrs. Preen for a few
minutes, Valentine then made his way to Mrs. Cramp&rsquo;s,
where he would stay. He knew his mother was away, and
her house shut up. Mrs. Cramp, recovering from her surprise,
told him he was welcome as the sun in harvest. She
had been more grieved when Valentine went wrong than
the world suspected.</p>

<p>Seated over the fire, in her comfortable parlour, after
supper, Valentine told her his plans. He had come over for
one month; could not leave his farm longer; just to shake
hands with them all, and to take Jane Preen back with him.
That discussed, Mrs. Cramp entered gingerly upon the sad
news about Juliet&mdash;not having thought well to deluge him
with it the moment he came in. Valentine refused to
believe it&mdash;as he had refused with Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless the boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Cramp, staring.
&ldquo;What on earth makes him say such a thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am sure of it, Aunt Mary Ann. Fancy
strong-minded Juliet throwing herself into an eel pond!
She is gadding about somewhere, deep already, I daresay,
in another flirtation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cramp, waiting to collect her scattered senses, shook
her head plaintively. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend
to know the fashion of things in the outlandish world
in which you live, but over here it couldn&rsquo;t be. Once a
girl has been drowned in a pond&mdash;whether eel, duck, or
carp pond, what matters it?&mdash;she can&rsquo;t come to life again
and go about flirting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To us all Valentine was, as Mrs. Cramp had phrased it,
more welcome than the sun in harvest, and was made much
of. When a young fellow has been going to the bad, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
has the resolution to pull up and to persevere, he should be
honoured, cried the Squire&mdash;and we did our best to honour
Val. For a week or two there was nothing but visiting
everywhere. He was then going to Guernsey to see his
mother, when she wrote to stop him, saying she was coming
back to Crabb for his wedding.</p>

<p>And while Valentine was reading his mother&rsquo;s letter at the
tea-table&mdash;for the Channel Islands letters always came in by
the second post&mdash;Mrs. Cramp was opening one directed to
her. Suddenly Valentine heard a gurgle&mdash;and next a moan.
Looking up, he saw his aunt gasping for breath, her face an
indescribable mixture of emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Mary Ann,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not ill, I might be,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Cramp.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter from that wretched girl&mdash;that Juliet! She&rsquo;s
not dead after all. She has been in Guernsey all this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Valentine paused a moment to take in the truth of the
announcement, and then burst into laughter deep and long.
Mrs. Cramp handed him the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Mary Ann</span>,&mdash;I hope you will forgive me!
Georgie writes word that you have been in a way about me.
I thought you&rsquo;d be <em>sure</em> to guess it was only a trick. I did
it to give a thorough fright to that wicked cat; you can&rsquo;t
think how full of malice she is. I put on my old navy-blue
serge and close winter bonnet, which no one would be likely
to miss or remember, and carried the other things to the
edge of the pond and left them there. While you were at
supper I stole away, caught the last train at Crabb Junction,
and surprised Clementina at Edgbaston. She promised to
be secret&mdash;she hates that she-cat&mdash;and the next morning I
started for Guernsey. Clementina did not tell Georgie till
a week ago, after she heard that Valentine would not believe
it, and then Georgie wrote to me and blew me up. I am
enchanted to hear that the toad passes her nights in horrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
fear of seeing my ghost, and that her yellow hair is turning
blue; Georgie says it is.&mdash;Your ever affectionate and repentant
niece,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Julietta.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I hope you will believe I am very sorry for paining
you, dear Aunt Mary Ann. And I want to tell you
that I think it likely I shall soon be married. An old
gentleman out here who has a beautiful house and lots of
money admires me very much. Please let Fred Scott
know this.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And so, there it was&mdash;Julietta was in the land of the
living and had never been out of it. And we had gone
through our fright and pain unnecessarily, and the poor eels
had been disturbed for nothing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were married at the little church at Duck Brook; no
ceremony, hardly anyone invited to it. Mr. Preen gave
Jane away. Tom Chandler and Emma were there, and Mrs.
Jacob Chandler and Mrs. Cramp. Jane asked me to go&mdash;to
see the last of her, she said. She wore a plain silk dress
of a greyish colour, and a white straw bonnet with a bit of
orange blossom&mdash;which she took off before they started on
their journey. For they went off at once to Liverpool&mdash;and
would sail the next day for their new home.</p>

<p>And Valentine is always steady and prospering, and Jane
says Canada is better than England and she wouldn&rsquo;t come
back for the world.</p>

<p>And Juliet is married and lives in Guernsey, and drives
about with her old husband in his handsome carriage and
pair. But Mrs. Cramp has not forgiven her yet.</p>

<h2>THE SILENT CHIMES</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;PUTTING THEM UP</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The events of this history did not occur within my own
recollection, and I can only relate them at second-hand&mdash;from
the Squire and others. They are curious enough;
especially as regard the three parsons&mdash;one following upon
another&mdash;in their connection with the Monk family, causing
no end of talk in Church Leet parish, as well as in other
parishes within earshot.</p>

<p>About three miles&rsquo; distance from Church Dykely, going
northwards across country, was the rural parish of Church
Leet. It contained a few farmhouses and some labourers&rsquo;
cottages. The church, built of grey stone, stood in its large
graveyard; the parsonage, a commodious house, was close
by; both of them were covered with time-worn ivy. Nearly
half a mile off, on a gentle eminence, rose the handsome
mansion called Leet Hall, the abode of the Monk family.
Nearly the whole of the parish&mdash;land, houses, church and
all&mdash;belonged to them. At the time I am about to tell of
they were the property of one man&mdash;Godfrey Monk.</p>

<p>The late owner of the place (except for one short twelvemonth)
was old James Monk, Godfrey&rsquo;s father. Old James
had three sons and one daughter&mdash;Emma&mdash;his wife dying
early. The eldest son (mostly styled &ldquo;young James&rdquo;) was
about as wild a blade as ever figured in story; the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
son, Raymond, was an invalid; the third, Godfrey, a reckless
lad, ran away to sea when he was fourteen.</p>

<p>If the Monks were celebrated for one estimable quality
more than another, it was temper: a cross-grained, imperious,
obstinate temper. &ldquo;Run away to sea, has he?&rdquo;
cried old James when he heard the news; &ldquo;very well, at sea
he shall stop.&rdquo; And at sea Godfrey did stop, not disliking
the life, and perhaps not finding any other open to him.
He worked his way up in the merchant service by degrees,
until he became commander and was called Captain Monk.</p>

<p>The years went on. Young James died, and the other
two sons grew to be middle-aged men. Old James, the
father, found by signs and tokens that his own time was
approaching; and he was the next to go. Save for a
slender income bequeathed to Godfrey and to his daughter,
the whole of the property was left to Raymond, and to
Godfrey after him if Raymond had no son. The entail had
been cut off in the past generation; for which act the
reasons do not concern us.</p>

<p>So Raymond, ailing greatly always, entered into possession
of his inheritance. He lived about a twelvemonth afterwards,
and then died: died unmarried. Therefore Godfrey
came into all.</p>

<p>People were curious, the Squire says, as to what sort of
man Godfrey would turn out to be; for he had not troubled
home much since he ran away. He was a widower; that
much was known; his wife having been a native of Trinidad,
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>A handsome man, with fair, curling hair (what was left of
it); proud blue eyes; well-formed features with a chronic
flush upon them, for he liked his glass, and took it; a commanding,
imperious manner, and a temper uncompromising
as the grave. Such was Captain Godfrey Monk; now in
his forty-fifth year. Upon his arrival at Leet Hall after
landing, with his children and one or two dusky attendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in their train, he was received by his sister Emma, Mrs.
Carradyne. Major Carradyne had died fighting in India,
and his wife, at the request of her brother Raymond, came
then to live at Leet Hall. Not of necessity, for Mrs.
Carradyne was well off and could have made her home
where she pleased, but Raymond had liked to have her.
Godfrey also expressed his pleasure that she should remain;
she could act as mother to his children.</p>

<p>Godfrey&rsquo;s children were three: Katherine, aged seventeen;
Hubert, aged ten; and Eliza, aged eight. The girls had
their father&rsquo;s handsome features, but in their skin there ran
a dusky tinge, hinting of other than pure Saxon blood; and
they were every whit as haughtily self-willed as he was.
The boy, Hubert, was extremely pretty, his face fair, his
complexion delicately beautiful, his auburn hair bright, his
manner winning; but he liked to exercise his own will, and
appeared to have generally done it.</p>

<p>A day or two, and Mrs. Carradyne sat down aghast. &ldquo;I
never saw children so troublesome and self-willed in all my
life, Godfrey,&rdquo; she said to her brother. &ldquo;Have they ever
been controlled at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had their own way pretty much, I expect,&rdquo; answered
the Captain. &ldquo;I was not often at home, you know, and
there&rsquo;s nobody else they&rsquo;d obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Godfrey, if I am to remain here, you will have to
help me manage them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be, Emma. When I deem it necessary
to speak, I speak; otherwise I don&rsquo;t interfere. And
you must not get into the habit of appealing to me,
recollect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk&rsquo;s conversation was sometimes interspersed
with sundry light words, not at all orthodox, and not
necessarily delivered in anger. In those past days swearing
was regarded as a gentleman&rsquo;s accomplishment; a sailor, it
was believed, could not at all get along without it. Manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
change. The present age prides itself upon its politeness:
but what of its sincerity?</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne, mild and gentle, commenced her task of
striving to tame her brother&rsquo;s rebellious children. She might
as well have let it alone. The girls laughed at her one
minute and set her at defiance the next. Hubert, who had
good feeling, was more obedient; he did not openly defy
her. At times, when her task pressed heavily upon her
spirits, Mrs. Carradyne felt tempted to run away from Leet
Hall, as Godfrey had run from it in the days gone by. Her
own two children were frightened at their cousins, and she
speedily sent both to school, lest they should catch their bad
manners. Henry was ten, the age of Hubert; Lucy was
between five and six.</p>

<p>Just before the death of Raymond Monk, the living of
Church Leet became vacant, and the last act of his life was
to present it to a worthy young clergyman named George
West. This caused intense dissatisfaction to Godfrey. He
had heard of the late incumbent&rsquo;s death, and when he
arrived home and found the living filled up he proclaimed
his anger loudly, lavishing abuse upon poor dead Raymond
for his precipitancy. He had wanted to bestow it upon a
friend of his, a Colonial chaplain, and had promised it to
him. It was a checkmate there was no help for now, for
Mr. West could not be turned out again; but Captain Monk
was not accustomed to be checkmated, and resented it
accordingly. He took up, for no other reason, a most
inveterate dislike to George West, and showed it practically.</p>

<p>In every step the Vicar took, at every turn and thought,
he found himself opposed by Captain Monk. Had he a
suggestion to make for the welfare of the parish, his patron
ridiculed it; did he venture to propose some wise measure
at a vestry meeting, the Captain put him and his measure
down. Not civilly either, but with a stinging contempt,
semi-covert though it was, that made its impression on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
farmers around. The Reverend George West was a man of
humility, given to much self-disparagement, so he bore all in
silence and hoped for better times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The time went on; three years of it; Captain Monk had
fully settled down in his ancestral home, and the neighbours
had learnt what a domineering, self-willed man he was.
But he had his virtues. He was kind in a general way,
generous where it pleased him to be, inordinately attached
to his children, and hospitable to a fault.</p>

<p>On the last day of every year, as the years came round,
Captain Monk, following his late father&rsquo;s custom, gave a
grand dinner to his tenants; and a very good custom it
would have been, but that he and they got rather too jolly.
The parson was always invited&mdash;and went; and sometimes
a few of Captain Monk&rsquo;s personal friends were added.</p>

<p>Christmas came round this year as usual, and the invitations
to the dinner went out. One came to Squire
Todhetley, a youngish man then, and one to my father,
William Ludlow, who was younger than the Squire. It was
a green Christmas; the weather so warm and genial that the
hearty farmers, flocking to Leet Hall, declared they saw
signs of buds sprouting in the hedges, whilst the large fire
in the Captain&rsquo;s dining-room was quite oppressive.</p>

<p>Looking from the window of the parsonage sitting-room
in the twilight, while drawing on his gloves, preparatory to
setting forth, stood Mr. West. His wife was bending over
an easy-chair, in which their only child, little Alice, lay back,
covered up. Her breathing was quick, her skin parched
with fever. The wife looked sickly herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it is time to go,&rdquo; observed Mr. West,
slowly. &ldquo;I shall be late if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather wonder you go at all, George,&rdquo; returned his
wife. &ldquo;Year after year, when you come back from this
dinner, you invariably say you will not go to another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, Mary. I dislike the drinking that goes on&mdash;and
the free conversation&mdash;and the objectionable songs; I
feel out of place in it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Captain&rsquo;s contemptuous treatment of yourself,
you might add.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is another unwelcome item in the evening&rsquo;s
programme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, George, why <em>do</em> you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you know why. I do not like to refuse
the invitation; it would only increase Captain Monk&rsquo;s
animosity and widen still further the breach between us. As
patron he holds so much in his power. Besides that, my
presence at the table does act, I believe, as a mild restraint
on some of them, keeping the drinking and the language
somewhat within bounds. Yes, I suppose my duty lies in
going. But I shall not stay late, Mary,&rdquo; added the parson,
bending to look at the suffering child; &ldquo;and if you see any
real necessity for the doctor to be called in to-night, I will
go for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dood-bye, pa-pa,&rdquo; lisped the little four-year-old maiden.</p>

<p>He kissed the little hot face, said adieu to his wife and
went out, hoping that the child would recover without the
doctor; for the living of Church Leet was but a poor one,
though the parsonage house was so handsome. It was a
hundred-and-sixty pounds a year, for which sum the tithes
had been compounded, and Mr. West had not much money
to spare for superfluities&mdash;especially as he had to substantially
help his mother.</p>

<p>The twilight had deepened almost to night, and the lights
in the mansion seemed to smile a cheerful welcome as he
approached it. The pillared entrance, ascended to by
broad steps, stood in the middle, and a raised terrace of
stone ran along before the windows on either side. It was
quite true that every year, at the conclusion of these feasts,
the Vicar resolved never to attend another; but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
essentially a man of peace, striving ever to lay oil upon
troubled waters, after the example left by his Master.</p>

<p>Dinner. The board was full. Captain Monk presided,
genial to-day; genial even to the parson. Squire Todhetley
faced the Captain at the foot; Mr. West sat at the Squire&rsquo;s
right hand, between him and Farmer Threpp, a quiet man
and supposed to be a very substantial one. All went on
pleasantly; but when the elaborate dinner gave place to
dessert and wine-drinking, the company became rather
noisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about time you left us,&rdquo; cried the Squire
by-and-by to young Hubert, who sat next him on the other
side: and over and over again Mr. Todhetley has repeated
to us in later years the very words that passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, yes!&rdquo; put in a bluff and hearty fox-hunter,
the master of the hounds, bending forward to look at the
lad, for he was in a line with him, and breaking short off an
anecdote he was regaling the company with. &ldquo;I forgot
you were there, Master Hubert. Quite time you went
to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay!&rdquo; laughed the boy. &ldquo;Please let me alone,
all of you. I don&rsquo;t want attention drawn to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the slight commotion had attracted Captain Monk&rsquo;s
notice. He saw his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;Hubert! What brings you there now,
you young pirate? I ordered you to go out with the cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not doing any harm, papa,&rdquo; said the boy, turning
his fair and beautiful face towards his father.</p>

<p>Captain Monk pointed his stern finger at the door; a
mandate which Hubert dared not disobey, and he went
out.</p>

<p>The company sat on, an interminable period of time it
seemed to the Vicar. He glanced stealthily at his watch.
Eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking of going, Parson?&rdquo; said Mr. Threpp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
go with you. My head&rsquo;s not one of the strongest, and I&rsquo;ve
had about as much as I ought to carry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rose quietly, not to disturb the table; intending to
steal away, if possible, without being observed. Unluckily,
Captain Monk chanced to be looking that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa! who&rsquo;s turning sneak?&mdash;Not you, surely,
Parson!&mdash;&rdquo; in a meaningly contemptuous tone. &ldquo;And <em>you</em>,
Threpp, of all men! Sit down again, both of you, if you
don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with me. Odds fish! has my dining-room
got sharks in it, that you&rsquo;d run away? Winter, just
lock the door, will you; you are close to it, and pass up the
key to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Winter, a jovial old man and the largest tenant on
the estate, rose to do the Captain&rsquo;s behest, and sent up the
key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody quits my room,&rdquo; said the host, as he took it,
&ldquo;until we have seen the old year out and the new one in.
What else do you come for&mdash;eh, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The revelry went on. The decanters circulated more
quickly, the glasses clinked, the songs became louder, the
Captain&rsquo;s sea stories broader. Mr. West perforce made the
best of the situation, certain words of Holy Writ running
through his memory:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth
its colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, more than well, for Captain Monk, that he had not
looked upon the red wine that night!</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, the hall clock began to strike
twelve. The Captain rose, after filling his glass to the brim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bumpers round, gentlemen. On your legs. Ready?
Hooray! Here&rsquo;s to the shade of the year that&rsquo;s gone, and
may it have buried all our cares with it! And here&rsquo;s good
luck to the one setting in. A happy New Year to you all;
and may we never know a moment in it worse than the
present? Three-times-three&mdash;and drain your glasses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have had the toast too soon!&rdquo; called out one of
the farmers, making the discovery close after the cheers
had subsided. &ldquo;It wants some minutes yet to midnight,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk snatched out his watch&mdash;worn in those
days in what was called the fob-pocket&mdash;its chain and bunch
of seals at the end hanging down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jupiter!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Hang that butler of
mine! He knew the hall clock was too fast, and I told him
to put it back. If his memory serves him no better than
this, he may ship himself off to a fresh berth.&mdash;Hark!
Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the church clock striking twelve. The sound
reached the dining-room room very clearly, the wind setting
that way. &ldquo;Another bumper,&rdquo; cried the Captain, and his
guests drank it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This day twelvemonth I was at a feast in Derbyshire;
the bells of a neighbouring church rang in the year with
pleasant melody; chimes they were,&rdquo; remarked a guest,
who was a partial stranger. &ldquo;Your church has no bells, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has one; an old ting-tang that calls us to service on
a Sunday,&rdquo; said Mr. Winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to hear those midnight chimes, for my part. I like
to hear them chime in the new year,&rdquo; went on the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chimes!&rdquo; cried out Captain Monk, who was getting
very considerably elated, &ldquo;why should we not have chimes?
Mr. West, why don&rsquo;t we have chimes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our church does not possess any, sir&mdash;as this gentleman
has just remarked,&rdquo; was Mr. West&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad, but that parson of ours is going to set us all ablaze
with his wit!&rdquo; jerked out the Captain ironically. &ldquo;I asked,
sir, why we should not get a set of chimes; I did not say
we had got them. Is there any just cause or impediment
why we should not, Mr. Vicar?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the expense,&rdquo; replied the Vicar, in a conciliatory
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother expense! That&rsquo;s what you are always
wanting to groan over. Mr. Churchwarden Threpp, we will
call a vestry meeting and make a rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parish could not bear it, Captain Monk,&rdquo; remonstrated
the clergyman. &ldquo;You know what dissatisfaction
was caused by the last extra rate put on, and how low an
ebb things are at just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I will a thing, I do it,&rdquo; retorted the Captain, with
a meaning word or two. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send out the rate and we&rsquo;ll
get the chimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will, I fear, lie in my duty to protest against it,&rdquo;
spoke the uneasy parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may lie in your duty to be a wet blanket, but you
won&rsquo;t protest me out of my will. Gentlemen, we will all
meet here again this time twelvemonth, when the chimes
shall ring-in the new year for you.&mdash;&mdash; Here, Dutton, you
can unlock the door now,&rdquo; concluded the Captain, handing
the key to the other churchwarden. &ldquo;Our parson is upon
thorns to be away from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not the parson only, but several others availed themselves
of the opportunity to escape.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>It perhaps did not surprise the parish to find that its owner
and master, Captain Monk, intended to persist in his resolution
of embellishing the church-tower with a set of chiming-bells.
They knew him too well to hope anything less.
Why! two years ago, at the same annual feast, some remarks
or other at table put it into his head to declare he would
stop up the public path by the Rill; and his obstinate will
carried it out, regardless of the inconvenience it caused.</p>

<p>A vestry meeting was called, and the rate (to obtain funds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for the bells) was at length passed. Two or three voices
were feebly lifted in opposition; Mr. West alone had courage
to speak out; but the Captain put him down with his strong
hand. It may be asked why Captain Monk did not provide
the funds himself for this whim. But he would never touch
his own pocket for the benefit of the parish if he could help
it: and it was thought that his antagonism to the parson
was the deterring motive.</p>

<p>To impose the rate was one thing, to collect it quite
another. Some of the poorer ratepayers protested with
tears in their eyes that they could not pay. Superfluous
rates (really not necessary ones) were perpetually being
inflicted upon them, they urged, and were bringing them,
together with a succession of recent bad seasons, to the
verge of ruin. They carried their remonstrances to their
Vicar, and he in turn carried them to Captain Monk.</p>

<p>It only widened the breach. The more persistently,
though gently, Mr. West pleaded the cause of his parishioners,
asking the Captain to be considerate to them for humanity&rsquo;s
sake, the greater grew the other&rsquo;s obstinacy in holding to
his own will. To be thus opposed roused all the devil
within him&mdash;it was his own expression; and he grew to hate
Mr. West with an exceeding bitter hatred.</p>

<p>The chimes were ordered&mdash;to play one tune only. Mr.
West asked, when the thing was absolutely inevitable, that
at least some sweet and sacred melody, acceptable to church-going
ears, might be chosen; but Captain Monk fixed on a
sea-song that was a favourite of his own&mdash;&ldquo;The Bay of
Biscay.&rdquo; At the end of every hour, when the clock had
struck, the Bay of Biscay was to burst forth to charm the
parish.</p>

<p>The work was put in hand at once, Captain Monk finding
the necessary funds, to be repaid by the proceeds of the
rate. Other expenses were involved, such as the strengthening
of the belfry. The rate was not collected quickly. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
was, I say, one of those times of scarcity that people used to
talk so much of years ago; and when the parish beadle, who
was the parish collector, went round with the tax-paper in
his hand, the poorer of the cottagers could not respond to
it. Some of them had not paid the last levy, and Captain
Monk threatened harsh measures. Altogether, what with
one thing or another, Church Leet that year was kept in a
state of ferment. But the work went on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One windy day in September, Mr. West sat in his study
writing a sermon, when a jarring crash rang out from the
church close by. He leaped from his chair. The unusual
noise had startled him; and it struck on every chord of
vexation he possessed. He knew that workmen were busy
in the tower, but this was the first essay of the chimes. The
bells had clashed in some way one upon the other; not
giving out The Bay of Biscay or any other melody, but a
very discordant jangle indeed. It was the first and the last
time that poor George West heard their sound.</p>

<p>He put the blotting-paper upon his sermon; he was in
no mind to continue it then; took up his hat and went out.
His wife spoke to him from the open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going out now, George? Tea is all but
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning back on the path, he passed into the sitting-room.
A cup of tea might soothe his nerves. The tea-tray stood
on the table, and Mrs. West, caddy in hand, was putting the
tea into the tea-pot. Little Alice sat gravely by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear dat noise up in the church, papa?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard it, dear,&rdquo; sighed the Vicar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine clashing!&rdquo; cried Mrs. West. &ldquo;I have heard
something else this afternoon, George, worse than that:
Bean&rsquo;s furniture is being taken away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the Vicar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Sarah went out on an errand and passed the
cottage. The chairs and tables were being put outside the
door by two men, she says: brokers, I conclude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. West made short work of his tea and started for the
scene. Thomas Bean was a very small farmer indeed,
renting about thirty acres. What with the heavy rates, as
he said, and other outgoings and bad seasons, and ill-luck
altogether, he had been behind in his payments this long
while; and now the ill-luck seemed to have come to a
climax. Bean and his wife were old; their children were
scattered abroad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; cried the old lady when she saw the Vicar, the
tears raining from her eyes, &ldquo;it cannot be right that this
oppression should fall upon us! We had just managed&mdash;Heaven
knows how, for I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t&mdash;to pay the
Midsummer rent; and now they&rsquo;ve come upon us for
the rates, and have took away things worth ten times the
sum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the rates!&rdquo; mechanically spoke the Vicar.</p>

<p>She supposed it was a question. &ldquo;Yes, sir; two of &rsquo;em
we had in the house. One was for putting up the chimes;
and the other&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t just remember what the other
was. The beadle, old Crow, comes in, sir, this afternoon.
&lsquo;Where be the master?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Gone over to t&rsquo;other
side of Church Dykely,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says he, upon that,
&lsquo;you be going to have some visitors presently, and it&rsquo;s a
pity he&rsquo;s out.&rsquo; &lsquo;Visitors, for what, Crow?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Oh,
you&rsquo;ll see,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;and then perhaps you&rsquo;ll wish you&rsquo;d
bestirred yourselves to pay your just dues. Captain Monk&rsquo;s
patience have been running on for a goodish while, and at
last it have run clean out.&rsquo; Well, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had to make a pause; unable to control her grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she went on presently, &ldquo;Crow&rsquo;s back was
hardly turned, when up came two men, wheeling a truck.
I saw &rsquo;em afar off, by the ricks yonder. One came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
in; t&rsquo;other stayed outside with the truck. He asked me
whether I was ready with the money for the taxes; and I
told him I was not ready, and had but a couple of shillings
in the house. &lsquo;Then I must take the value of it in kind,&rsquo;
says he. And without another word, he beckons in the
outside man to help him. Our middle table, a mahogany,
they seized; and the handsome oak chest, which had been
our pride; and the master&rsquo;s arm-chair&mdash;&mdash; But, there! I
can&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. West felt nearly as sorrowful as she, and far more
angry. In his heart he believed that Captain Monk had
done this oppressive thing in revenge. A great deal of
ill-feeling had existed in the parish touching the rate made
for the chimes; and the Captain assumed that the few who
had not yet paid it <em>would</em> not pay&mdash;not that they could
not.</p>

<p>Quitting the cottage in an impulse of anger, he walked
swiftly to Leet Hall. It lay in his duty, as he fully deemed,
to avow fearlessly to Captain Monk what he thought of this
act of oppression, and to protest against it. The beams of
the setting sun, sinking below the horizon in the still autumn
evening, fell across the stubbled fields from which the corn
had not long been reaped; all around seemed to speak
of peace.</p>

<p>To accommodate two gentlemen who had come from
Worcester that day to Leet Hall on business, and wished to
quit it again before dark, the dinner had been served earlier
than usual. The guests had left, but Captain Monk was
seated still over his wine in the dining-room when Mr. West
was shown in. In crossing the hall to it, he met Mrs.
Carradyne, who shook hands with him cordially.</p>

<p>Captain Monk looked surprised. &ldquo;Why, this is an unexpected
pleasure&mdash;a visit from you, Mr. Vicar,&rdquo; he cried,
in mocking jest. &ldquo;Hope you have come to your senses!
Sit down. Will you take port or sherry?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Monk,&rdquo; returned the Vicar, gravely, as he took
the chair the servant had placed, &ldquo;I am obliged for your
courtesy, but I did not intrude upon you this evening to
drink wine. I have seen a very sad sight, and I am come
hoping to induce you to repair it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen what?&rdquo; cried the Captain, who, it is well to mention,
had been taking his wine very freely, even for him. &ldquo;A
flaming sword in the sky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your tenants, poor Thomas Bean and his wife, are being
turned out of house and home, or almost equivalent to it.
Some of their furniture has been seized this afternoon to
satisfy the demand for these disputed taxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who disputes the taxes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tax imposed for the chimes was always a disputed
tax; and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; interrupted the Captain; &ldquo;Bean owes other
things as well as taxes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the last feather, sir, which broke the camel&rsquo;s
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last feather will not be taken off, whether it breaks
backs or leaves them whole,&rdquo; retorted the Captain, draining
his glass of port and filling it again. &ldquo;Take you note of
that, Mr. Parson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Others are in the same condition as the Beans&mdash;quite
unable to pay these rates. I pray you, Captain Monk&mdash;I
am here to <em>pray</em> you&mdash;not to proceed in the same manner
against them. I would also pray you, sir, to redeem this
act of oppression by causing their goods to be returned to
these two poor, honest, hard-working people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; retorted the Captain, aroused to
anger. &ldquo;A pretty example <em>you&rsquo;d</em> set, let you have your
way. Every one of the lot shall be made to pay to the last
farthing. Who the devil is to pay, do you suppose, if
they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rates are imposed upon the parish needlessly, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Monk; it has been so ever since my time here. Pardon me
for saying that if you put up chimes to gratify yourself, you
should bear the expense, and not throw it upon those who
have a struggle to get bread to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk drank off another glass. &ldquo;Any more
treason, Parson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. West, &ldquo;if you like to call it so. My
conscience tells me that the whole procedure in regard to
setting up these chimes is so wrong, so manifestly unjust,
that I have determined not to allow them to be heard until
the rates levied for them are refunded to the poor and
oppressed. I believe I have the power to close the belfry-tower,
and I shall act upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! do you think <em>you</em> are going to stand between
me and my will?&rdquo; cried the Captain passionately. &ldquo;Every
individual who has not yet paid the rate shall be made to
pay it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another world, Captain Monk,&rdquo; interposed the
mild voice of the minister, &ldquo;to which, I hope, we are
all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you attempt to preach to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a spoon fell to the ground by the sideboard.
The Vicar turned to look; his back was towards
it; the Captain peered also at the end of the rapidly-darkening
room: when both became aware that one of the
servants&mdash;Michael, who had shown in Mr. West&mdash;stood
there; had stood there all the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for, sirrah?&rdquo; roared his master.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want <em>you</em>. Here! put this window open an inch
or two before you go; the room&rsquo;s close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I bring lights, sir?&rdquo; asked Michael, after doing as
he was directed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No: who wants lights? Stir the fire into a blaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael left them. It was from him that thus much of
the conversation was subsequently known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Not five minutes had elapsed when a commotion was
heard in the dining-room. Then the bell rang violently,
and the Captain opened the door&mdash;overturning a chair in
his passage to it&mdash;and shouted out for a light. More than
one servant flew to obey the order: in his hasty moods their
master brooked not delay: and three separate candles were
carried in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good lack, master!&rdquo; exclaimed the butler, John
Rimmer, who was a native of Church Dykely, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s amiss
with the Parson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lift him up, and loosen his neck-cloth,&rdquo; said Captain
Monk, his tone less imperious than usual.</p>

<p>Mr. West lay on the hearthrug near his chair, his head
resting close to the fender. Rimmer raised his head,
another servant took off his black neck-tie; for it was only
on high days that the poor Vicar indulged in a white one.
He gasped twice, struggled slightly, and then lay quietly in
the butler&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; burst forth the man in a horror-stricken voice
to his master, &ldquo;this is surely death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It surely was. George West, who had gone there but
just before in the height of health and strength, had breathed
his last.</p>

<p>How did it happen? How could it have happened? Ay,
how indeed? It was a question which has never been
entirely solved in Church Leet to this day.</p>

<p>Captain Monk&rsquo;s account, both privately and at the inquest,
was this: As they talked further together, after Michael left
the room, the Vicar went on to browbeat him shamefully
about the new chimes, vowing they should never play, never
be heard; at last, rising in an access of passion, the Parson
struck him (the Captain) in the face. He returned the blow&mdash;who
wouldn&rsquo;t return it?&mdash;and the Vicar fell. He believed
his head must have struck against the iron fender in falling:
if not, if the blow had been an unlucky one (it took effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
just behind the left ear), it was only given in self-defence.
The jury, composed of Captain Monk&rsquo;s tenants, expressed
themselves satisfied, and returned a verdict of Accidental
Death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A false account,&rdquo; pronounced poor Mrs. West, in her
dire tribulation. &ldquo;My husband never struck him&mdash;never;
he was not one to be goaded into unbecoming anger, even
by Captain Monk. <em>George struck no blow whatever</em>; I
can answer for it. If ever a man was murdered, he has
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curious rumours arose. It was said that Mrs. Carradyne,
taking the air on the terrace outside in the calmness of the
autumn evening, heard the fatal quarrel through the open
window; that she heard Mr. West, after he had received
the death blow, wail forth a prophecy (or whatever it might
be called) that those chimes would surely be accursed; that
whenever their sound should be heard, so long as they were
suffered to remain in the tower, it should be the signal of
woe to the Monk family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne utterly denied this; she had not been on
the terrace at all, she said. Upon which the onus was
shifted to Michael: who, it was suspected, had stolen out to
listen to the end of the quarrel, and had heard the ominous
words. Michael, in his turn, also denied it; but he was not
believed. Anyway, the covert whisper had gone abroad
and would not be laid.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Captain Monk speedily filled up the vacant living, appointing
to it the Reverend Thomas Dancox, an occasional visitor
at Leet Hall, who was looking out for one.</p>

<p>The new Vicar turned out to be a man after the Captain&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
heart, a rollicking, jovial, fox-hunting young parson, as many
a parson was in those days&mdash;and took small blame to himself
for it. He was only a year or two past thirty, good-looking,
of taking manners and hail-fellow-well-met with the
parish in general, who liked him and called him to his face
Tom Dancox.</p>

<p>All this pleased Captain Monk. But very soon something
was to arrive that did not please him&mdash;a suspicion that the
young parson and his daughter Katherine were on rather
too good terms with one another.</p>

<p>One day in November he stalked into the drawing-room,
where Katherine was sitting with her aunt. Hubert and
Eliza were away at school, also Mrs. Carradyne&rsquo;s two
children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Dancox here last night?&rdquo; began Captain Monk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Carradyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the evening before&mdash;Monday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne felt half afraid to answer, the Captain&rsquo;s
tone was becoming so threatening. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think so,&rdquo; she
rather hesitatingly said. &ldquo;Was he not, Katherine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katherine Monk, a dark, haughty young woman, twenty-one
now, turned round with a flush on her handsome face.
&ldquo;Why do you ask, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask to be answered,&rdquo; replied he, standing with his
hands in the pockets of his velveteen shooting-coat, a purple
tinge of incipient anger rising in his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Dancox did spend Monday evening here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I saw him walking with you in the meadow by the
rill this morning,&rdquo; continued the Captain. &ldquo;Look here,
Katherine, <em>no sweethearting with Tom Dancox</em>. He may
do very well for a parson; I like him as such, as such
only, you understand; but he can be no match for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are disturbing yourself unnecessarily, sir,&rdquo; said
Katherine, her own tone an angry one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope that is so; I should not like to think
otherwise. Anyway, a word in season does no harm;
and, take you notice that I have spoken it. You also,
Emma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he left the room, Mrs. Carradyne spoke, dropping her
voice: &ldquo;Katherine, you know that I had already warned
you. I told you it would not do to fall into any particular
friendship with Mr. Dancox; that your father would never
countenance it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I were to?&mdash;and if he did not?&rdquo; scornfully
returned Katherine. &ldquo;What then, Aunt Emma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent, child; you must not talk in that strain. Your
papa is perfectly right in this matter. Tom Dancox is not
suitable in any way&mdash;for <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This took place in November. Katherine paid little heed
to the advice; she was not one to put up with advice of any
sort, and she and Mr. Dancox met occasionally under the
rose. Early in December she went with Mr. Dancox into
the Parsonage, while he searched for a book he was about
to lend her. That was the plea; the truth, no doubt, being
that the two wanted a bit of a chat in quiet. As ill-luck
had it, when she was coming out again, the Parson
in attendance on her as far as the gate, Captain Monk
came by.</p>

<p>A scene ensued. Captain Monk, in a terrible access of
passion, vowed by all the laws of the Medes and Persians,
which alter not, that never, in life or after death, should those
two rebellious ones be man and wife, and he invoked
unheard-of penalties on their heads should they dare to
contemplate disobedience to his decree.</p>

<p>Thenceforth there was no more open rebellion; upon the
surface all looked smooth. Captain Monk understood the
folly to be at an end: that the two had come to their
senses; and he took Tom Dancox back into favour. Mrs.
Carradyne assumed the same. But Katherine had her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
father&rsquo;s unyielding will, and the Parson was bold and careless,
and in love.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last day of the year came round, and the usual
banquet would come with it. The weather this Christmas
was not like that of last; the white snow lay on the ground,
the cold biting frost hardened the glistening icicles on
the trees.</p>

<p>And the chimes? Ready these three months past, they
had not yet been heard. They would be to-night. Whether
Captain Monk wished the remembrance of Mr. West&rsquo;s death
to die away a bit first, or that he preferred to open the treat
on the banqueting night, certain it was that he had kept
them silent. When the church clock should toll the midnight
knell of the old year, the chimes would ring out to
welcome the new one, and gladden the ears of Church
Leet.</p>

<p>But not without a remonstrance. That morning, as the
Captain sat in his study writing a letter, Mrs. Carradyne
came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Godfrey,&rdquo; she said in a low and pleading tone, &ldquo;you
will not suffer the chimes to play to-night, will you? Pray
do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not suffer the chimes to play?&rdquo; cried the Captain.
&ldquo;But indeed I shall. Why, this is the special night they
were put up for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, Godfrey. But&mdash;you cannot think what a
strangely strong feeling I have against it: an instinct, it
seems to me. The chimes have brought nothing but discomfort
and disaster yet; they may bring more in the
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk stared at her. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean,
Emma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I would never let them be heard</em>,&rdquo; she said impressively.
&ldquo;I would have them taken down again. The story went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
about, you know, that poor George West in dying prophesied
that whenever they should be heard woe would fall upon
this house. I am not superstitious, Godfrey, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheer passion had tied, so far, Godfrey Monk&rsquo;s lips.
&ldquo;Not superstitious!&rdquo; he raved out. &ldquo;You are worse than
that, Emma&mdash;a fool. How dare you bring your nonsense
here? There&rsquo;s the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The banquet hour approached. Nearly all the guests of
last year were again present in the warm and holly-decorated
dining-room, the one notable exception being the ill-fated
Parson West. Parson Dancox came in his stead, and said
grace from the post of honour at the Captain&rsquo;s right hand.
Captain Monk did not appear to feel any remorse or regret:
he was jovial, free, and grandly hospitable; one might
suppose he had promoted the dead clergyman to a canonry
instead of to a place in the churchyard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of the poor man&rsquo;s widow, Squire?&rdquo;
whispered a gentleman from the neighbourhood of Evesham
to Mr. Todhetley, who sat on the left hand of his host;
Sir Thomas Rivers taking the foot of the table this
year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. West? Well, we heard she opened a girls&rsquo; school
up in London,&rdquo; breathed the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what tale was that about his leaving a curse on
the chimes?&mdash;I never heard the rights of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the Squire cautiously. &ldquo;Nobody talks of
that here. Or believes it, either. Poor West was a man to
leave a blessing behind him; never a curse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubert, at home for the holidays, was again at table.
He was fourteen now, tall of his age and slender, his blue
eyes bright, his complexion delicately beautiful. The
pleated cambric frill of his shirt, which hung over the collar
of his Eton jacket after the fashion of the day, was carried
low in front, displaying the small white throat; his golden
hair curled naturally. A boy to admire and be proud of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
The manners were more decorous this year than they ever
had been, and Hubert was allowed to sit on. Possibly the
shadow of George West&rsquo;s unhappy death lay insensibly upon
the party.</p>

<p>It was about half-past nine o&rsquo;clock when the butler came
into the room, bringing a small note, twisted up, to his
master from Mrs. Carradyne. Captain Monk opened it and
held it towards one of the lighted branches to read the few
words it contained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>A gentleman is asking to speak a word to Mr. Dancox.
He says it is important.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Monk tore the paper to bits. &ldquo;<em>Not to-night</em>, tell
your mistress, is my answer,&rdquo; said he to Rimmer. &ldquo;Hubert,
you can go to your aunt now; it&rsquo;s past your bed-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There could be no appeal, as the boy knew; but he
went off unwillingly and in bitter resentment against Mrs.
Carradyne. He supposed she had sent for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a cross old thing you are, Aunt Emma!&rdquo; he
exclaimed as he entered the drawing-room on the other
side the hall. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let Harry go in at all to the
banquets, and you won&rsquo;t let me stay at them! Papa meant&mdash;I
think he meant&mdash;to let me remain there to hear the
chimes. Why need you have interfered to send for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I neither interfered with you, Hubert, nor sent for you.
A gentleman, who did not give his name and preferred to
wait outside, wants to see Mr. Dancox; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Carradyne. &ldquo;You gave my note to your master,
Rimmer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the butler. &ldquo;My master bade me
say to you that his answer was <em>not to-night</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katherine Monk, her face betraying some agitation, rose
from the piano. &ldquo;Was the message not given to Mr.
Dancox?&rdquo; she asked of Rimmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not while I was there, Miss Katherine. The master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
tore the note into bits, after reading it; and dropped them
under the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Mr. Dancox, glancing covertly at the
note while the Captain held it to the light, had read what
was written there. For a few minutes he said nothing.
The Captain was busy sending round the wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Monk&mdash;pardon me&mdash;I saw my name on that
bit of paper; it caught my eye as you held it out,&rdquo; he said
in a low tone. &ldquo;Am I called out? Is anyone in the
parish dying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus questioned, Captain Monk told the truth. No one
was dying, and he was not called out to the parish. Some
gentleman was asking to speak to him; only that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll just see who it is, and what he wants,&rdquo; said
Mr. Dancox, rising. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be away two minutes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him back with you; tell him he&rsquo;ll find good wine
here and jolly cheer,&rdquo; said the Captain. And Mr. Dancox
went out, swinging his napkin in his hand.</p>

<p>In crossing the hall he met Katherine, exchanged a hasty
word with her, let fall the serviette on a chair as he caught
up his hat and overcoat, and went out. Katherine ran
upstairs.</p>

<p>Hubert lay down on one of the drawing-room sofas. In
point of fact, that young gentleman could not walk straight.
A little wine takes effect on youngsters, especially when
they are not accustomed to it. Mrs. Carradyne told Hubert
the best place for him was bed. Not a bit of it, the boy
answered: he should go out on the terrace at twelve
o&rsquo;clock; the chimes would be fine, heard out there. He
fell asleep almost as he spoke; presently he woke up, feeling
headachy, cross and stupid, and of his own accord went
up to bed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dining-room was getting jollier and louder
as the time passed on towards midnight. Great wonder was
expressed at the non-return of the parson; somebody must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
be undoubtedly grievously sick or dying. Mr. Speck, the
quiet little Hurst Leet doctor, dissented from this. Nobody
was dying in the parish, he affirmed, or sick enough to need
a priest; as a proof of it, <em>he</em> had not been sent for.</p>

<p>Ring, ring, ring! broke forth the chimes on the quiet
midnight air, as the church clock finished striking twelve.
It was a sweet sound; even those prejudiced against the
chimes could hear that: the windows had been opened in
readiness.</p>

<p>The glasses were charged; the company stood on their
legs, some of them not at all steady legs just then, bending
their ears to listen. Captain Monk stood in his place,
majestically waving his head and his left hand to keep time
in harmony with The Bay of Biscay. His right hand held
his goblet in readiness for the toast when the sounds should
cease.</p>

<p>Ring, ring, ring! chimed the last strokes of the bells,
dying away to faintness on the still evening air. Suddenly,
amidst the hushed silence, and whilst the sweet melody fell
yet unbroken on the room, there arose a noise as of something
falling outside on the terrace, mingled with a wild
scream and the crash of breaking glass.</p>

<p>One of the guests rushed to the window, and put his head
out of it. So far as he could see, he said (perhaps his sight
was somewhat obscured), it was a looking-glass lying further
up on the terrace.</p>

<p>Thrown out from one of the upper windows! scornfully
pronounced the Captain, full of wrath that it should
have happened at that critical moment to mar the dignity
of his coming toast. And he gave the toast heartily; and
the new year came in for them all with good wishes and
good wine.</p>

<p>Some little time yet ere the company finally rose. The
mahogany frame of the broken looking-glass, standing on
end, was conspicuous on the white ground in the clear frosty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
night, as they streamed out from the house. Mr. Speck,
whose sight was rather remarkably good, peered at it
curiously from the hall steps, and then walked quickly along
the snowy terrace towards it.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it was a looking-glass, broken in its fall from
an open window above. But, lying by it in the deep snow,
in his white night-shirt, was Hubert Monk.</p>

<p>When the chimes began to play, Hubert was not asleep.
Sitting up in bed, he disposed himself to listen. After a bit
they began to grow fainter; Hubert impatiently dashed to
the window and threw it up to its full height as he jumped
on the dressing-table, when in some unfortunate way he overbalanced
himself, and pitched out on the terrace beneath,
carrying the looking-glass with him. The fall was not much,
for his room was in one of the wings, the windows of which
were low; but the boy had struck his head in falling, and
there he had lain, insensible, on the terrace, one hand still
clasping the looking-glass.</p>

<p>All the rosy wine-tint fading away to a sickly paleness on
the Captain&rsquo;s face, he looked down on his well-beloved son.
The boy was carried indoors to his room, reviving with the
movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young bones are elastic,&rdquo; pronounced Mr. Speck, when
he had examined him; &ldquo;and none of these are broken.
He will probably have a cold from the exposure; that&rsquo;s
about the worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed to have it already: he was shivering from
head to foot now, as he related the above particulars. All
the family had assembled round him, except Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Katherine?&rdquo; suddenly inquired her father,
noticing her absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot think where she is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carradyne. &ldquo;I
have not seen her for an hour or two. Eliza says she is not
in her room; I sent her to see. She is somewhere about, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and look for your sister, Eliza. Tell her to come
here,&rdquo; said Captain Monk. But though Eliza went at once,
her quest was useless.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine was not in the house: Miss Katherine
had made a moonlight flitting from it that evening with the
Reverend Thomas Dancox.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE SILENT CHIMES</h2>


<h3>II.&mdash;PLAYING AGAIN</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It could not be said the Church Leet chimes brought good
when they rang out that night at midnight, as the old year
was giving place to the new. Mrs. Carradyne, in her
superstition, thought they brought evil. Certainly evil set
in at the same time, and Captain Monk, with all his scoffing
obstinacy, could not fail to see it. That fine young lad,
his son, fell through the window listening to them; and
in the self-same hour the knowledge reached him that
Katherine, his eldest and dearest child, had flown from his
roof in defiant disobedience, to set up a home of her own.</p>

<p>Hubert was soon well of his bruises; but not of the cold
induced by lying in the snow, clad only in his white night-shirt.
In spite of all Mr. Speck&rsquo;s efforts, rheumatic fever
set in, and for some time Hubert hovered between life
and death. He recovered; but would never again be the
strong, hearty lad he had been&mdash;though indeed he had
never been very physically strong. The doctor privately
hoped that the heart would be found all right in future, but
he would not have answered for it.</p>

<p>The blow that told most on Captain Monk was that
inflicted by Katherine. And surely never was disobedient
marriage carried out with the impudent boldness of hers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Church Leet called it &ldquo;cheek.&rdquo; Church Leet (disbelieving
the facts when they first oozed out) could talk of nothing
else for weeks. For Katherine had been married in the
church hard by, that same night.</p>

<p>Special licenses were very uncommon things in those
days; they cost too much; but the Reverend Thomas
Dancox had procured one. With Katherine&rsquo;s money:
everybody guessed that. She had four hundred a-year of
her own, inherited from her dead mother, and full control
over it. So the special license was secured, and their crafty
plans were laid. The stranger who had presented himself
at the Hall that night (by arrangement), asking for Mr.
Dancox, thus affording an excuse for his quitting the
banquet-room, was a young clergyman of Worcester, come
over especially to marry them. When tackled with his
deed afterwards, he protested that he had not been told the
marriage was to be clandestine. Tom Dancox went out to
him from the banquet; Katherine, slipping on a bonnet
and shawl, joined them outside; they hastened to the
rectory and thence into the church. And while the unconscious
master of Leet Hall was entertaining his guests
with his good cheer and his stories and his hip, hip, hurrah,
his Vicar and Katherine Monk were made one until death
should them part. And death, as it proved, intended to do
that speedily.</p>

<p>At first Captain Monk, in his unbounded rage, was for
saying that a marriage celebrated at ten o&rsquo;clock at night by
the light of a solitary tallow candle, borrowed from the
vestry, could not hold good. Reassured upon this point,
he strove to devise other means to part them. Foiled
again, he laid the case before the Bishop of Worcester,
and begged his lordship to unfrock Thomas Dancox. The
Bishop did not do as much as that; though he sent for
Tom Dancox and severely reprimanded him. But that, as
Church Leet remarked, did not break bones. Tom had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
striven to make the best of his own cause to the Bishop,
and the worst of Captain Monk&rsquo;s obdurate will; moreover,
stolen marriages were not thought much of in those days.</p>

<p>An uncomfortable state of things was maintained all the
year, Hall Leet and the Parsonage standing at daggers
drawn. Never once did Captain Monk appear at church.
If he by cross-luck met his daughter or her husband abroad,
he struck into a good fit of swearing aloud; which perhaps
relieved his mind. The chimes had never played again;
they pertained to the church, and the church was in ill-favour
with the Captain. As the end of the year approached,
Church Leet wondered whether he would hold the annual
banquet; but Captain Monk was not likely to forego that.
Why should he? The invitations went out for it; and they
contained an intimation that the chimes would again play.</p>

<p>The banquet took place, a neighbouring parson saying
grace at it in the place of Tom Dancox. While the enjoyment
was progressing and Captain Monk was expressing his
marvel for the tenth time as to what could have become
of Speck, who had not made his appearance, a note was
brought in by Rimmer&mdash;just as he had brought in one last
year. This also was from Mrs. Carradyne.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Please come out to me for one moment, dear Godfrey. I
must say a word to you.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Monk&rsquo;s first impulse on reading this was to send
Rimmer back to say she might go and be hanged. But to
call him from the table was so very extreme a measure,
that on second thoughts he decided to go to her. Mrs.
Carradyne was standing just outside the door, looking as
white as a sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is pretty bold of you, Madam Emma,&rdquo; he
began angrily. &ldquo;Are you out of your senses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Godfrey! Katherine is dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the Captain, the words confusing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Katherine is dying,&rdquo; repeated his sister, her teeth
chattering with emotion.</p>

<p>In spite of Katherine&rsquo;s rebellion, Godfrey Monk loved
her still as the apple of his eye; and it was only his
obstinate temper which had kept him from reconciliation.
His face took a hue of terror, and his voice a softer tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her baby&rsquo;s born; something has gone wrong, I suppose,
and she is dying. Sally ran up with the news, sent by Mr.
Speck. Katherine is crying aloud for you, saying she cannot
die without your forgiveness. Oh, Godfrey, you will go,
you will surely go!&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Carradyne, breaking
down with a burst of tears. &ldquo;Poor Katherine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never another word spoke he. He went out at the hall-door
there and then, putting on his hat as he leaped down
the steps. It was a wretched night; not white, clear, and
cold as the last New Year&rsquo;s Eve had been, or mild and
genial as the one before it; but damp, raw, misty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I have remained hard and defiant, father,&rdquo;
Katherine whispered to him, &ldquo;but I have many a time
asked God&rsquo;s forgiveness on my bended knees; and I longed&mdash;oh,
how I longed!&mdash;to ask yours. What should we all
do with the weight of sin that lies on us when it comes
to such an hour as this, but for Jesus Christ&mdash;for God&rsquo;s
wonderful mercy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with one hand in her father&rsquo;s and the other in her
husband&rsquo;s, both their hearts aching to pain, and their eyes
wet with bitter tears, poor Katherine&rsquo;s soul passed away.</p>

<p>After quitting the parsonage, Captain Monk was softly
closing the garden gate behind him&mdash;for when in sorrow we
don&rsquo;t do things with a rush and a bang&mdash;when a whirring
sound overhead caused him to start. Strong, hardened
man though he was, his nerves were unstrung to-night in
company with his heartstrings. It was the church clock
preparing to strike twelve. The little doctor, Speck, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
had left the house but a minute before, was standing at the
churchyard fence close by, his arms leaning on the rails,
probably ruminating sadly on what had just occurred.
Captain Monk halted beside him in silence, while the clock
struck.</p>

<p>As the last stroke vibrated on the air, telling the knell of
the old year, the dawn of the new, another sound began.</p>

<p>Ring, ring, ring! Ring, ring, ring!</p>

<p>The chimes! The sweet, soothing, melodious chimes,
carolling forth The Bay of Biscay. Very pleasant were they
in themselves to the ear. But&mdash;did they fall pleasantly on
Captain Monk&rsquo;s? It may be, not. It may be, a wish
came over him that he had never thought of instituting
them. But for doing that, the ills of his recent life had
never had place. George West&rsquo;s death would not have lain
at his door, or room been made by it for Tom Dancox, and
Katherine would not be lying as he had now left her&mdash;cold
and lifeless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could <em>nothing</em> have been done to save her, Speck?&rdquo; he
whispered to the doctor, whose arms were still on the
churchyard railings, listening to the chimes in silence&mdash;though
indeed he had asked the same question indoors
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing; or you may be sure, sir, it would have been,&rdquo;
answered Mr. Speck. &ldquo;Had all the medical men in
Worcestershire been about her, they could not have saved
her any more than I could. These unfortunate cases
happen now and then,&rdquo; sighed he, &ldquo;showing us how powerless
we really are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, it was grievous news wherewith to startle the parish.
And Mrs. Carradyne, a martyr to belief in ghosts and
omens, grew to dread the chimes with a nervous and nameless
dread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>It was but the first of February, yet the weather might have
served for May-day: one of those superb days that come
once in a while out of their season, serving to remind the
world that the dark, depressing, dreary winter will not last
for ever; though we may have half feared it means to,
forgetting the reassuring promise of the Divine Ruler of all
things, given after the Flood:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold
and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall
not cease.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The warm and glorious sunbeams lay on Church Leet, as
if to woo the bare hedges into verdant life, the cold fields
to smiling plains. Even the mounds of the graveyard,
interspersed amidst the old tombstones, looked green and
cheerful to-day in the golden light.</p>

<p>Turning slowly out of the Vicarage gate came a good-looking
clergyman of seven-or-eight-and-twenty. A slender
man of middle height, with a sweet expression on his pale,
thoughtful face, and dark earnest eyes. It was the new
Vicar of Church Leet, the Reverend Robert Grame.</p>

<p>For a goodish many years have gone on since that
tragedy of poor Katherine&rsquo;s death, and this is the second
appointed Vicar since that inauspicious time.</p>

<p>Mr. Grame walked across the churchyard, glancing at the
inscriptions on the tombs. Inside the church porch stood
the clerk, old John Cale, keys in hand. Mr. Grame saw
him and quickened his pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I kept you waiting, Cale?&rdquo; he cried in his
pleasant, considerate tones. &ldquo;I am sorry for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, your reverence; I came afore the time.
This here church is but a step or two off my home, yonder,
and I&rsquo;m as often out here as I be indoors,&rdquo; continued John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Cale, a fresh-coloured little man with pale grey eyes and
white hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been clerk here, sir, for seven-and-thirty
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen more than one parson out then, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than one! Ay, sir, more than&mdash;more than six
times one, I was going to say; but that&rsquo;s too much, maybe.
Let&rsquo;s see: there was Mr. Cartright, he had held the living
I hardly know how many years when I came, and he held
it for many after that. Mr. West succeeded him&mdash;the
Reverend George West; then came Thomas Dancox; then
Mr. Atterley: four in all. And now you&rsquo;ve come, sir, to
make the fifth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they all die? or take other livings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some the one thing, sir, and some the other. Mr.
Cartright died, he was old; and Mr. West, he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; John
Cale hesitated before he went on&mdash;&ldquo;he died; Mr.
Dancox got appointed to a chaplaincy somewhere over the
seas; he was here but about eighteen months, hardly that;
and Mr. Atterley, who has just left, has had a big church with
a big income, they say, given to him over in Oxfordshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which makes room for me,&rdquo; smiled Robert Grame.</p>

<p>They were inside the church now; a small and very old-fashioned
church, with high pews, dark and sombre. Over
the large pew of the Monks, standing sideways to the
pulpit, sundry slabs were on the wall, their inscriptions
testifying to the virtues and ages of the Monk family dead
and gone. Mr. Grame stood to read them. One slab of
white marble, its black letters fresh and clear, caught
especially his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Katherine, eldest child of Godfrey Monk, gentleman,
and wife of the Reverend Thomas Dancox,&rdquo; he read out
aloud. &ldquo;Was that he who was Vicar here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, &rsquo;twas. She married him again her father&rsquo;s wish, and
died, poor thing, just a year after it,&rdquo; replied the clerk.
&ldquo;And only twenty-three, as you see, sir! The Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
came down and forgave her on her dying bed, and &rsquo;twas he
that had the stone put up there. Her baby-girl was taken
to the Hall, and is there still: ten years old she must be
now; &rsquo;twas but an hour or two old when the mother died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a sad history,&rdquo; observed Mr. Grame as he
turned away to enter the vestry.</p>

<p>John Cale did the honours of its mysteries: showing him
the chest for the surplices; the cupboard let into the wall
for the register; the place where candles and such-like
stores were kept. Mr. Grame opened a door at one end
of the room and saw a square flagged place, containing
grave-digging tools and the hanging ropes of the bell which
called people to church. Shutting the door again, he
crossed to a door on the opposite side. But that he could
not open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this lead to?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It is locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always kept locked, that door is, sir; and it&rsquo;s a&rsquo;most
as much as my post is worth to open it,&rdquo; said the clerk, his
voice sinking to a mysterious whisper. &ldquo;It leads up to the
chimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chimes!&rdquo; echoed the new parson in surprise. &ldquo;Do
you mean to say this little country church can boast of
chimes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Cale nodded. &ldquo;Lovely, pleasant things they be to
listen to, sir, but we&rsquo;ve not heard &rsquo;em since the midnight
when Miss Katherine died. They play a tune called &lsquo;The
Bay o&rsquo; Biscay.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selecting a key from the bunch that he carried in his
hand, he opened the door, displaying a narrow staircase,
unprotected as a ladder and nearly perpendicular. At the
top was another small door, evidently locked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Monk had all this done when he put the chimes
up,&rdquo; remarked he. &ldquo;I sweep the dust off these stairs once
in three months or so, but otherwise the door&rsquo;s not opened.
And that one,&rdquo; nodding to the door above, &ldquo;never.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked the clergyman. &ldquo;If the chimes are
there, and are, as you say, melodious, why do they not
play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I b&rsquo;lieve there&rsquo;s a bit of superstition at the
bottom of it,&rdquo; returned the clerk, not caring to explain too
fully lest he should have to tell about Mr. West&rsquo;s death,
which might not be the thing to frighten a new Vicar with.
&ldquo;A feeling has somehow got abroad in the parish (leastways
with a many of its folk) that the putting-up of its bells
brought ill-luck, and that whenever the chimes ring out
some dreadful evil falls on the Monk family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing,&rdquo; exclaimed the Vicar,
hardly knowing whether to laugh or lecture. &ldquo;The parish
cannot be so ignorant as that! How can the putting-up of
chimes bring ill-luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your reverence, I don&rsquo;t know; the thing&rsquo;s beyond
me. They were heard but three times, ringing in the new
year at midnight, three years, one on top of t&rsquo;other&mdash;and
each time some ill fell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good man&mdash;and I am sure you are good&mdash;you
should know better,&rdquo; remonstrated Mr. Grame. &ldquo;Captain
Monk cannot surely give credence to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but his sister up at the Hall does&mdash;Mrs.
Carradyne. It&rsquo;s said the Captain used to ridicule her finely
for it; he&rsquo;d fly into a passion whenever &rsquo;twas alluded to.
Captain Monk, as a brave seaman, is too bold to tolerate
anything of the sort. But he has never let the chimes play
since his daughter died. He was coming out from the
death-scene at midnight, when the chimes broke forth the
third year, and it&rsquo;s said he can&rsquo;t abear the sound of &rsquo;em
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may well be,&rdquo; assented Mr. Grame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And finding, sir, year after year, year after year, as one
year gives place to another, that they are never heard, we
have got to call &rsquo;em amid ourselves, the Silent Chimes,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
spoke the clerk, as they turned to leave the church. &ldquo;The
Silent Chimes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clinking his keys, the clerk walked away to his home, an
ivy-covered cottage not a stone&rsquo;s-throw off; the clergyman
lingered in the churchyard, reading the memorials on the
tombstones. He was smiling at the quaintness of some of
them, when the sound of hasty footsteps caused him to turn.
A little girl was climbing over the churchyard-railings (as
being nearer to her than the entrance-gate), and came dashing
towards him across the gravestones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you grandpapa&rsquo;s new parson?&rdquo; asked the young
lady; a pretty child of ten, with a dark skin, and dusky-violet
eyes staring at him freely out of a saucy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is yours?&rdquo; boldly questioned she. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
talked about you at home, but I forgot it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is Robert Grame. Won&rsquo;t you tell me yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Kate.&mdash;Here&rsquo;s that wicked Lucy coming! She&rsquo;s
going to groan at me for jumping here. She says it&rsquo;s not
reverent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A charming young lady of some twenty years was coming
up the path, wearing a scarlet cloak, its hood lined with
white silk; a straw hat shaded her fair face, blushing very
much just now; in her dark-grey eyes might be read
vexation, as she addressed Mr. Grame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Kate has not been rude? I hope you will
excuse her heedlessness in this place. She is only a little
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the new parson, Lucy,&rdquo; broke in Kate without
ceremony. &ldquo;He says his name&rsquo;s Robert Grame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kate, don&rsquo;t! How shall we ever teach you
manners?&rdquo; reprimanded the young lady, in distress.
&ldquo;She has been very much indulged, sir,&rdquo; turning to the
clergyman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well understand that,&rdquo; he said, with a bright smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
&ldquo;I presume that I have the honour of speaking to the
daughter of my patron&mdash;Captain Monk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Captain Monk is my uncle: I am Lucy Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the young clergyman stood, hat in hand, a feeling
came over him that he had never seen so sweet a face as
the one he was looking at. Miss Lucy Carradyne was
saying to herself, &ldquo;What a nice countenance he has! What
kindly, earnest eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This little lady tells me her name is Kate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate Dancox,&rdquo; said Lucy, as the child danced away.
&ldquo;Her mother was Captain Monk&rsquo;s eldest daughter; she
died when Kate was born. My uncle is very fond of
Kate; he will hardly have her controlled at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been in to see my church! John Cale has been
doing its honours for me,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Grame. &ldquo;It is a
pretty little edifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I hope you will like it; I hope you will like
the parish,&rdquo; frankly returned Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be sure to do that, I think. As soon, at least, as
I can feel convinced that it is to be really mine,&rdquo; he added,
with a quaint expression. &ldquo;When I heard, a week ago,
that Captain Monk had presented me&mdash;an entire stranger to
him&mdash;with the living of Church Leet, I could not believe it.
It is not often that a nameless curate, without influence, is
spontaneously remembered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much of a living,&rdquo; said Lucy, meeting the words
half jestingly. &ldquo;Worth, I believe, about a hundred and
sixty pounds a-year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is a great rise for me&mdash;and I have a house to
myself large and beautiful&mdash;and am a Vicar and no longer
a curate,&rdquo; he returned, laughingly. &ldquo;I cannot <em>imagine</em>,
though, how Captain Monk came to give it me. Have you
any idea how it was, Miss Carradyne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucy&rsquo;s face flushed. She could not tell this gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the truth: that another clergyman had been fixed upon,
one who would have been especially welcome to the
parishioners; that Captain Monk had all but nominated
him to the living. But it chanced to reach the Captain&rsquo;s
ears that this clergyman had expressed his intention of
holding the Communion service monthly, instead of
quarterly as heretofore, so he put the question to him.
Finding it to be true, he withdrew his promise; he would
not have old customs broken in upon by modern innovation,
he said; and forthwith he appointed the Reverend
Robert Grame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not even know how Captain Monk heard of me,&rdquo;
continued Mr. Grame, marking Lucy&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you were recommended to him by one of the
clergy attached to Worcester Cathedral,&rdquo; said Lucy.&mdash;&ldquo;And
I think I must wish you good-morning now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there came an interruption. A tall, stately, haughty
young woman, with an angry look upon her dark and handsome
face, had entered the churchyard, and was calling out
as she advanced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That monkey broken loose again, I suppose, and at her
pranks here! What are you good for, Lucy, if you cannot
keep her in better order? You know I told you to go
straight on to Mrs. Speck, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words died away. Mr. Grame, who had been
hidden by a large upright tombstone, emerged into view.
Lucy, with another blush, spoke to cover the awkwardness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Monk,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Eliza, it is the
new clergyman, Mr. Grame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Monk recovered her equanimity. A winning
smile supplanted the anger on her face; she held out her
hand, grandly gracious. For she liked the stranger&rsquo;s look:
he was beyond doubt a gentleman&mdash;and an attractive
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to welcome you to Church Leet, Mr. Grame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
My father chances to be absent to-day; he is gone to
Evesham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the clerk told me, or I should have called this morning
to pay my respects to him, and to thank him for his
generous and most unexpected patronage of me. I got
here last night,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Grame, standing uncovered
as when he had saluted Lucy. Eliza Monk liked his
pleasant voice and taking manners: her fancy went out to
him there and then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But though papa is absent, you will walk up with me
now to the Hall to make acquaintance with my aunt, Mrs.
Carradyne,&rdquo; said Eliza, in tones that, gracious though
they were, sounded in the light of a command&mdash;just as poor
Katherine&rsquo;s had always sounded. And Mr. Grame went
with her.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;handsome though she was, gracious though she
meant to be&mdash;there was something about Eliza Monk that
seemed to repulse Robert Grame, rather than attract him.
Lucy had fascinated him; she repelled. Other people had
experienced the same kind of repulsion, but knew not
where it lay.</p>

<p>Hubert, the heir, about twenty-five now, came forward to
greet the stranger as they entered the Hall. No repulsion
about <em>him</em>. Robert Grame&rsquo;s hand met his with a warm
clasp. A young man of gentle manners and a face of rare
beauty&mdash;but oh, so suspiciously delicate! Perhaps it was
the extreme slenderness of the frame, the wan look in the
refined features and their bright hectic that drew forth the
clergyman&rsquo;s sympathy. An impression came over him that
this young man was not long for earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Monk strong?&rdquo; he presently asked of Mrs.
Carradyne, when Hubert had temporarily quitted the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no. He had rheumatic fever some years ago,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;and has never been strong since.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he heart disease?&rdquo; questioned the clergyman.
He thought the young man had just that look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We fear his heart is weak,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Carradyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that may be only your fancy, you know, Aunt
Emma,&rdquo; spoke Miss Monk reproachfully. She and her
father were both passionately attached to Hubert; they
resented any doubt cast upon his health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Carradyne, who never
resented anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be good friends, I trust,&rdquo; said Eliza, with a
beaming smile, as her hand lay in Mr. Grame&rsquo;s when he
was leaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I hope so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Summer lay upon the land. The landscape stretched out
before Leet Hall was fair to look upon. A fine expanse
of wood and dale, of trees in their luxuriant beauty; of
emerald-green plains, of meandering streams, of patches of
growing corn already putting on its golden hue, and of the
golden sunlight, soon to set and gladden other worlds, that
shone from the deep-blue sky. Birds sang in their leafy
shelters, bees were drowsily humming as they gathered the
last of the day&rsquo;s honey, and butterflies flitted from flower to
flower with a good-night kiss.</p>

<p>At one of the windows stood, in her haughty beauty,
Eliza Monk. Not, surely, of the lovely scene before her
was she thinking, or her face might have worn a more
pleasing expression. Rather did she seem to gaze, and
with displeasure, at two or three people who were walking
in the distance: Lucy Carradyne side by side with the
clergyman, and Miss Kate Dancox pulling at his coat-tails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shameful flirt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The acidity of the tone was so pronounced that Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Carradyne, seated near and busy at her netting, lifted her
head in surprise. &ldquo;Why, Eliza, what&rsquo;s the matter? Who
is a flirt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy,&rdquo; curtly replied Eliza, pointing with her finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carradyne, after glancing outwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does she persistently lay herself out to attract
that man?&rdquo; was the passionate rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent, Eliza. How can you conjure up so unjust
a charge? Lucy is not capable of <em>laying herself out</em> to
attract anyone. It lies but in your imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Day after day, when she is out with Kate, you may see
him join her&mdash;allured to her side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;allurer&rsquo; is Kate, then. I am surprised at you,
Eliza: you might be talking of a servant-maid. Kate has
taken a liking for Mr. Grame, and she runs after him at all
times and seasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ought to be stopped, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped! Will you undertake to do it? Could her
mother be stopped in anything she pleased to do? And
the child has the same rebellious will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say that Robert Grame&rsquo;s attraction is Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; acknowledged Mrs. Carradyne. &ldquo;But
the attraction must lie in Lucy herself; not in anything
she does. Some suspicion of the sort has, at times,
crossed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at them again as she spoke. They were
sauntering onwards slowly; Mr. Grame bending towards
Lucy, and talking earnestly. Kate, dancing about, pulling
at his arm or his coat, appeared to get but little attention.
Mrs. Carradyne quietly went on with her work.</p>

<p>And that composed manner, combined with her last
sentence, brought gall and wormwood to Eliza Monk.</p>

<p>Throwing a summer scarf upon her shoulders, Eliza
passed out at the French window, crossed the terrace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
set out to confront the conspirators. But she was not in
time. Seeing her coming, or not seeing her&mdash;who knew?&mdash;Mr.
Grame turned off with a fleet foot towards his home.
So nobody remained for Miss Monk to waste her angry
breath upon but Lucy. The breath was keenly sharp, and
Lucy fell to weeping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here, Grame. Don&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words fell on the clergyman&rsquo;s ears as he closed the
Vicarage gate behind him, and was passing up the path to
his door. Turning his head, he saw Hubert Monk seated
on the bench under the may tree, pink and lovely yet.
&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; he asked, sitting down
beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever so long; waiting for you,&rdquo; replied Hubert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only strolling about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you: with Lucy and the child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had become fast and firm friends, these two young
men; and the minister was insensibly exercising a wonderful
influence over Hubert for good. Believing&mdash;as he did
believe&mdash;that Hubert&rsquo;s days were numbered, that any sharp
extra exertion might entail fatal consequences, he gently
strove, as opportunity offered, to lead his thoughts to the
Better Land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an evening it is!&rdquo; rapturously exclaimed Hubert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay: so calm and peaceful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rays of the setting sun touched Hubert&rsquo;s face,
lighting up its extreme delicacy; the scent of the closing
flowers filled the still air with sweetness; the birds were
chanting their evening song of praise. Hubert, his elbow
on the arm of the bench, his hand supporting his chin,
looked out with dreamy eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What book have you there?&rdquo; asked Mr. Grame,
noticing one in his other hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herbert,&rdquo; answered the young man, showing it. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
filched it from your table through the open window,
Grame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clergyman took it. It chanced to open at a passage
he was very fond of. Or perhaps he knew the place, and
opened it purposely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know these verses, Hubert? They are appropriate
enough just now, while those birds are carolling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. What verses? Read them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Hark, how the birds do sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And woods do ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All creatures have their joy, and man hath his,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet, if we rightly measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Man&rsquo;s joy and pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather hereafter than in present is.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Not that we may not here<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Taste of the cheer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as birds drink and straight lift up the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So must he sip and think<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of better drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He may attain to after he is dead.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Hubert, breaking the silence after a time,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s very true, I suppose. But this world&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s worth
living for. Will anything in the next, Grame, be more
beautiful than <em>that</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was pointing to the sunset, marvellously and unusually
beautiful. Lovely pink and crimson clouds flecked
the west; in their midst shone a dazzling golden light
too glorious to look upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One might fancy it the portals of heaven,&rdquo; said the
clergyman; &ldquo;the golden gate of entrance, leading to the
pearly gates within, and to the glittering walls of precious
stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! And it seems to take the form of an entrance-gate!&rdquo;
exclaimed Hubert; for it really did so. &ldquo;Look at
it! Oh, Grame, surely the very gate of Heaven cannot
be more wonderful than that!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And if the gate of entrance is so unspeakably beautiful,
what will the City itself be?&rdquo; murmured Mr. Grame.
&ldquo;The Heavenly City! the New Jerusalem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is beginning to fade,&rdquo; said Hubert presently, as they
sat watching; &ldquo;the brightness is going. What a pity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that&rsquo;s bright must fade in this world, you know;
and fade very quickly. Hubert! it will not in the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Church Leet, watching its neighbours&rsquo; doings sharply,
began to whisper that the new clergyman, Mr. Grame, was
likely to cause unpleasantness to the Monk family, just as
some of his predecessors had caused it. For no man
having eyes in his head (still less any woman) could fail
to see that the Captain&rsquo;s imperious daughter had fallen
desperately in love with him. Would there be a second
elopement, as in the days of Tom Dancox? Would Eliza
Monk set her father at defiance as Katherine did?</p>

<p>One of the last to see signs and tokens, though they took
place under her open eyes, was Mrs. Carradyne. But she
saw at last. The clergyman could not walk across a new-mown
field, or down a shady lane, or be hastening along
the dusty turnpike road, but by some inexplicable coincidence
he would be met by Miss Monk; and when he came
to the Hall to pass an hour with Hubert, she generally
made a third at the interview. It had pleased her latterly
to take to practising on the old church organ; and if Mr.
Grame was not wiled into the church with her and her
attendant, the ancient clerk, who blew the bellows, she was
sure to alight upon him in going or returning.</p>

<p>One fine evening, dinner over, when the last beams of
the sun were slanting into the drawing-room, Eliza Monk
was sitting back on a sofa, reading; Kate romped about
the room, and Mrs. Carradyne had just rung the bell for
tea. Lucy had been spending the afternoon with Mrs.
Speck, and Hubert had now gone to fetch her home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Kate, can&rsquo;t you be quiet!&rdquo; exclaimed
Miss Monk, as the child in her gambols sprang upon the
sofa, upsetting the book and its reader&rsquo;s temper. &ldquo;Go
away: you are treading on my flounces. Aunt Emma, why
do you persist in having this tiresome little reptile with us
after dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because your father will not let her be sent to the
nursery,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carradyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know a child like her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is only as her mother was; as you were, Eliza&mdash;always
rebellious. Kate, sit down to the piano and play
one of your pretty tunes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; responded Kate. &ldquo;Play yourself, Aunt Emma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dashing through the open glass doors, Kate began tossing
a ball on the broad gravel walk below the terrace. Mrs.
Carradyne cautioned her not to break the windows, and
turned to the tea-table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make the tea yet, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; interrupted
Miss Monk, in tones that were quite like a command.
&ldquo;Mr. Grame is coming, and he won&rsquo;t care for cold tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne returned to her seat. She thought the
opportunity had come to say something to her niece which
she had been wanting to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You invited Mr. Grame, Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Eliza, looking defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Carradyne with some hesitation,
&ldquo;forgive me if I offer you a word of advice. You
have no mother; I pray you to listen to me in her stead.
You must change your line of behaviour to Mr. Grame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eliza&rsquo;s dark face turned red and haughty. &ldquo;I do not
understand you, Aunt Emma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I think you do understand me, my dear. You
have incautiously allowed yourself to fall into&mdash;into an
undesirable liking for Mr. Grame. An <em>unseemly</em> liking,
Eliza.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Unseemly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; because it has not been sought. Cannot you see,
Eliza, how he instinctively recedes from it? how he would
repel it were he less the gentleman than he is? Child, I
shrink from saying these things to you, but it is needful.
You have good sense, Eliza, keen discernment, and you
might see for yourself that it is not to you Mr. Grame&rsquo;s
love is given&mdash;or ever will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For once in her life Eliza Monk allowed herself to betray
agitation. She opened her trembling lips to speak, but
closed them again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moment yet, Eliza. Let us suppose, for argument&rsquo;s
sake, that Mr. Grame loved you; that he wished to marry
you; you know, my dear, how utterly useless it would be.
Your father would not suffer it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Grame is of gentle descent; my father is attached
to him,&rdquo; disputed Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Grame has nothing but his living&mdash;a hundred
and sixty pounds a year; <em>you</em> must make a match in accordance
with your own position. It would be Katherine&rsquo;s
trouble, Katherine&rsquo;s rebellion over again. But this was
mentioned for argument&rsquo;s sake only; Mr. Grame will never
sue for anything of the kind; and I must beg of you, my
dear, to put all idea of it away, and to change your manner
towards him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you fancy he may wish to sue for Lucy!&rdquo; cried
Eliza, in fierce resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a great deal more likely than the other. And
the difficulties in her case would not be so great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray why, Aunt Emma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear, I should not resent it as your father
would. I am not so ambitious for her as he is for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine settlement for her&mdash;Robert Grame and his
hundred&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is taking my name in vain?&rdquo; cried a pleasant voice
from the open window; and Robert Grame entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Eliza readily; her tone changing like magic
to sweet suavity, her face putting on its best charm.
&ldquo;About to remark that the Reverend Robert Grame has a
hundred faults. Aunt Emma agrees with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed lightly, regarding it as pleasantry, and
inquired for Hubert.</p>

<p>Eliza stepped out on the terrace when tea was over, talking
to Mr. Grame; they began to pace it slowly together.
Kate and her ball sported on the gravel walk beneath. It
was a warm, serene evening, the silver moon shining, the
evening star just appearing in the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy being away, you cannot enjoy your usual flirtation
with her,&rdquo; remarked Miss Monk, in a light tone.</p>

<p>But he did not take it lightly. Rarely had his voice
been more serious than when he answered: &ldquo;I beg your
pardon. I do not flirt&mdash;I have never flirted with Miss
Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! It has looked like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grame remained silent. &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he said at
last. &ldquo;I did not intend&mdash;I did not think. However, I
must mend my manners,&rdquo; he added more gaily. &ldquo;To flirt
at all would ill become my sacred calling. And Lucy
Carradyne is superior to any such trifling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her pulses were coursing on to fever heat. With her
whole heart she loved Robert Grame: and the secret preference
he had unconsciously betrayed for Lucy had served
to turn her later days to bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly you mean something more serious,&rdquo; said Eliza,
compressing her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I mean anything, I should certainly mean it seriously,&rdquo;
replied the young clergyman, his face blushing as he made
the avowal. &ldquo;But I may not. I have been reflecting
much latterly, and I see I may not. If my income were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
good it might be a different matter. But it is not; and
marriage for me must be out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a portionless girl, yes. Robert Grame,&rdquo; she went
on rapidly with impassioned earnestness, &ldquo;when you marry,
it must be with someone who can help you; whose income
will compensate for the deficiency of yours. Look around
you well: there may be some young ladies rich in the world&rsquo;s
wealth, even in Church Leet, who will forget your want of
fortune for your own sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did he misunderstand her? It was hardly possible.
She had a large fortune; Lucy none. But he answered
as though he comprehended not. It may be that he
deemed it best to set her ill-regulated hopes at rest for
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One can hardly suppose a temptation of that kind
would fall in the way of an obscure individual like myself.
If it did, I could only reject it. I should not marry for
money. I shall never marry where I do not love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had halted near one of the terrace seats. On it
lay a toy of Kate&rsquo;s, a little wooden &ldquo;box of bells.&rdquo;
Mechanically, her mind far away, Eliza took it up and
began, still mechanically, turning the wire which set the
bells playing with a soft but not unpleasant jingle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You love Lucy Carradyne!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I do,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Though I have struggled
against the conviction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden crash startled them; shivers of glass fell before
their feet; fit accompaniment to the shattered hopes of one
who stood there. Kate Dancox, aiming at Mr. Grame&rsquo;s
hat, had sent her ball through the window. He leaped
away to catch the culprit, and Eliza Monk sat down on the
bench, all gladness gone out of her. Her love-dream had
turned out to be a snare and a delusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk, frightened from his after-dinner nap by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the crash, came forth in anger. Kate got a box on the ear,
and was sent to bed howling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should send her to school, papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will,&rdquo; declared the Captain. &ldquo;She startled me
out of a sleep. Out of a dream, too. And it is not often
I dream. I thought I was hearing the chimes again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chimes which I have not yet been fortunate enough to
hear at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Grame with a smile. Eliza recalled
the sound of the bells she had set in motion, and thought
it must have reached her father in his sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, no! You shall, though, Grame. They
shall ring the new year in when it comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma won&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; laughingly commented
Eliza. She was trying to be gay and careless before Robert
Grame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Emma may <em>dis</em>like it!&rdquo; retorted the Captain.
&ldquo;She has picked up some ridiculously absurd notion,
Grame, that the bells bring ill-luck when they are heard.
Women are so foolishly superstitious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be a very far-fetched superstition,&rdquo; said the
parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One might as well believe in witches,&rdquo; mocked the
Captain. &ldquo;I have given in to her fancies for some years,
not to cross her, and allowed the bells to be silent: she&rsquo;s
a good woman on the whole; but be hanged if I will any
longer. On the last day of this year, Grame, you shall
hear the chimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How it came about nobody exactly knew, unless it was
through Hubert, but matters were smoothed for the parson
and Lucy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne knew his worth, and she saw that they
were as much in love with one another as ever could be
Hodge and Joan. She liked the idea of Lucy being settled
near her&mdash;and the vicarage, large and handsome, could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
its unused rooms opened and furnished. Mr. Grame honestly
avowed that he should have asked for Lucy before, but for
his poverty; he supposed that Lucy was poor also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so; Lucy has nothing of her own,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Carradyne to this. &ldquo;But I am not in that condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. But&mdash;pardon me&mdash;I thought your
property went to your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne laughed. &ldquo;A small estate of his father&rsquo;s,
close by here, became my son&rsquo;s at his father&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;My own money is at my disposal; the half of it
will eventually be Lucy&rsquo;s. When she marries, I shall allow
her two hundred a year: and upon that, and your stipend,
you will have to get along together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be like riches to me,&rdquo; said the young parson all
in a glow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Wait until you realise the outlets for money that
a wife entails,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Carradyne in her superior
wisdom. &ldquo;Not but that I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s good for young
people, setting up together, to be straitened at the beginning.
It teaches them economy and the value of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Altogether it seemed a wonderful prospect to Robert
Grame. Miss Lucy thought it would be Paradise. But a
stern wave of opposition set in from Captain Monk.</p>

<p>Hubert broke the news to him as they were sitting
together after dinner. To begin with, the Captain, as a
matter of course, flew into a passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another of those beggarly parsons! What possessed
them, that they should fix upon <em>his</em> family to play off their
machinations upon! Lucy Carradyne was his niece: she
should never be grabbed up by one of them while he was
alive to stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, father,&rdquo; whispered Hubert. &ldquo;You like
Robert Grame; I know that: you would rather see him
carry off Lucy than Eliza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the dickens do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Hubert said a few cautious words&mdash;hinting that, but for
Lucy&rsquo;s being in the way, poor Katherine&rsquo;s escapade might
have been enacted over again. Captain Monk relieved his
mind by some strong language, sailor fashion; and for once
in his life saw he must give in to necessity.</p>

<p>So the wedding was fixed for the month of February, just
one year after they had met: that sweet time of early spring,
when spring comes in genially, when the birds would be
singing, and the green buds peeping and the sunlight
dancing.</p>

<p>But the present year was not over yet. Lucy was sewing
at her wedding things. Eliza Monk, smarting as from
an adder&rsquo;s sting, ran away to visit a family who lived near
Oddingly, an insignificant little place, lying, as everybody
knows, on the other side of Worcester, famous only for its
dullness and for the strange murders committed there in
1806&mdash;which have since passed into history. But she
returned home for Christmas.</p>

<p>Once more it was old-fashioned Christmas weather; Jack
Frost freezing the snow and sporting his icicles. The
hearty tenants, wending their way to the annual feast in
the winter twilight, said how unusually sharp the air was,
enough to bite off their ears and noses.</p>

<p>The Reverend Robert Grame made one at the table for
the first time, and said grace at the Captain&rsquo;s elbow. He
had heard about the freedom obtaining at these dinners;
but he knew he was utterly powerless to suppress it, and he
hoped his presence might prove some little restraint, just as
poor George West had hoped in the days gone by: not that
it was as bad now as it used to be. A rumour had gone
abroad that the chimes were to play again, but it died away
unconfirmed, for Captain Monk kept his own counsel.</p>

<p>The first to quit the table was Hubert. Captain Monk
looked up angrily. He was proud of his son, of his tall and
graceful form, of his handsome features, proud even of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
bright complexion; ay, and of his estimable qualities.
While inwardly fearing Hubert&rsquo;s signs of fading strength,
he defiantly refused to recognise it or to admit it openly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he said in a loud whisper. &ldquo;Are <em>you</em>
turning renegade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man bent over his father&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t feel well; better let me go quietly, father; I have
felt pain here all day&rdquo;&mdash;touching his left side. And he
escaped.</p>

<p>There was present at table an elderly gentleman named
Peveril. He had recently come with his wife into the
neighbourhood and taken on lease a small estate, called
by the odd name of Peacock&rsquo;s Range, which belonged to
Hubert and lay between Church Dykely and Church Leet.
Mr. Peveril put an inopportune question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the story, Captain, about some chimes which
were put up in the church here and are never allowed to
ring because they caused the death of the Vicar? I was
told of it to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk looked at Mr. Peveril, but did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One George West, I think. Was he parson here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was parson here,&rdquo; said Farmer Winter, finding
nobody else answered Mr. Peveril, next to whom he sat.
He was a very old man now, but hale and hearty still, and
a steadfast ally of his landlord. &ldquo;Given that parson his
way and we should never have had the chimes put up
at all. Sweet sounding bells they are, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could the chimes kill him?&rdquo; went on Mr.
Peveril. &ldquo;Did they kill him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George West was a quarrelsome, mischief-making
meddler, good for nothing but to set the parish together by
the ears; and I must beg of you to drop his name when at
my table, Peveril. As to the chimes, you will hear them
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk spoke in his sternest tones, and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Peveril bowed. Robert Grame had listened in surprise.
He wondered what it all meant&mdash;for nobody had ever
told him of this phase of the past. The table clapped its
unsteady hands and gave a cheer for the chimes, now to be
heard again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Captain, not a whit more
steady than his guests. &ldquo;They shall ring for us to-night,
though it brought the parson out of his grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes before twelve the butler, who had his
orders, came into the dining-room and set the windows
open. His master gave him another order and the man
withdrew. Entering the drawing-room, he proceeded to
open those windows also. Mr. Peveril, and one or two
more guests, sat with the family; Hubert lay back in an
easy-chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you about, Rimmer?&rdquo; hastily cried out Mrs.
Carradyne in surprise. &ldquo;Opening the windows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is by the master&rsquo;s orders, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the butler;
&ldquo;he bade me open them, that you and the ladies might get
a better hearing of the chimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne, superstitious ever, grew white as death.
&ldquo;<em>The chimes!</em>&rdquo; she breathed in a dread whisper. &ldquo;Surely,
surely, Rimmer, you must be mistaken. The chimes cannot
be going to ring again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are to ring the New Year in,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I
have known it this day or two, but was not allowed to tell,
as Madam may guess&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at his mistress. &ldquo;John
Cale has got his orders, and he&rsquo;ll set &rsquo;em going when the
clock has struck twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is there no one who will run to stop it?&rdquo; bewailed
Mrs. Carradyne, wringing her hands in all the terror of a
nameless fear. &ldquo;There may yet be time. Rimmer! can
you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubert came out of his chair laughing. Rimmer was
round and fat now, and could not run if he tried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
aunt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, walking slowly, I should get there
before Rimmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words, &ldquo;walking slowly,&rdquo; may have misled Mrs.
Carradyne; or, in the moment&rsquo;s tribulation, perhaps she
forgot that Hubert ought not to be the one to use much
exertion; but she made no objection. No one else made
way, and Hubert hastened out, putting on his overcoat as
he went towards the church.</p>

<p>It was the loveliest night; the air was still and clear, the
landscape white and glistening, the moon bright as gold.
Hubert, striding along at a quick walk, had traversed half
the short distance, when the church clock struck out the
first note of midnight. And he knew he should not be in
time&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He set off to run: it was such a very little way! Flying
along without heed to self, he reached the churchyard gate.
And there he was forced&mdash;forced&mdash;to stop to gather up his
laboured breath.</p>

<p>Ring, ring, ring! broke forth the chimes melodiously
upon Hubert&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he shouted, panting; &ldquo;stop!
stop!&rdquo;&mdash;just as if John Cale could hear the warning: and
he began leaping over the gravestones in his path, after
the irreverent fashion of Miss Kate Dancox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he faintly cried in his exhaustion, dashing
through the vestry, as the strains of &ldquo;The Bay of Biscay&rdquo;
pursued their harmonious course overhead, sounding louder
here than in the open air. &ldquo;Sto&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not end the word. Pulling the little door
open, he put his foot on the first step of the narrow ladder
of a staircase: and then fell prone upon it. John Cale and
young Mr. Threpp, the churchwarden&rsquo;s son, who had been
the clerk&rsquo;s companion, were descending the stairs, after the
chimes had chimed themselves out, and they had locked
them up again to (perhaps) another year, when they found
some impediment below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; exclaimed young Mr. Threpp. The clerk
turned on his lantern.</p>

<p>It was Hubert, Captain Monk&rsquo;s son and heir. He lay
there with a face of deadly whiteness, a blue shade encircling
his lips.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE SILENT CHIMES</h2>


<h3>III.&mdash;RINGING AT MIDDAY</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was an animated scene; and one you only find in
England. The stubble of the cornfields looked pale and
bleak in the departing autumn, the wind was shaking down
the withered leaves from the trees, whose thinning branches
told unmistakably of the rapidly-advancing winter. But the
day was bright after the night&rsquo;s frost, and the sun shone
on the glowing scarlet coats of the hunting-men, and the
hounds barked in every variety of note and leaped with
delight in the morning air. It was the first run of the
season, and the sportsmen were fast gathering at the appointed
spot&mdash;a field flanked by a grove of trees called
Poachers&rsquo; Copse.</p>

<p>Ten o&rsquo;clock, the hour fixed for the throw-off, came and
went, and still Poachers&rsquo; Copse was not relieved of its busy
intruders. Many a gentleman fox-hunter glanced at his
hunting-watch as the minutes passed, many a burly farmer
jerked his horse impatiently; while the grey-headed huntsman
cracked his long whip amongst his canine favourites
and promised them they should soon be on the scent. The
delay was caused by the non-arrival of the Master of the
Hounds.</p>

<p>But now all eyes were directed to a certain quarter, and
by the brightened looks and renewed stir, it might be thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
that he was appearing. A stranger, sitting his horse well
and quietly at the edge of Poachers&rsquo; Copse, watched the
newcomers as they came into view. Foremost of them
rode an elderly gentleman in scarlet, and by his side a
young lady who might be a few years past twenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father and daughter, I&rsquo;ll vow,&rdquo; commented the stranger,
noting that both had the same well-carved features, the
same defiant, haughty expression, the same proud bearing.
&ldquo;What a grandly-handsome girl! And he, I suppose, is
the man we are waiting for. Is that the Master of the
Hounds?&rdquo; he asked aloud of the horseman next him, who
chanced to be young Mr. Threpp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, that is Captain Monk,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;They
are saying yonder that he has brought word the Master
is taken ill and cannot hunt to-day&rdquo;&mdash;which proved to be
correct. The Master had been taken with giddiness when
about to mount his horse.</p>

<p>The stranger rode up to Captain Monk; judging him to
be regarded&mdash;by the way he was welcomed and the respect
paid him&mdash;as the chief personage at the meet, representing
in a manner the Master. Lifting his hat, he begged grace
for having, being a stranger, come out, uninvited, to join
the field; adding that his name was Hamlyn and he was
staying with Mr. Peveril at Peacock&rsquo;s Range.</p>

<p>Captain Monk wheeled round at the address; his head
had been turned away. He saw a tall, dark man of about
five-and-thirty years, so dark and sunburnt as to suggest
ideas of his having recently come from a warmer climate.
His hair was black, his eyes were dark brown, his features
and manner prepossessing, and he spoke as a man accustomed
to good society.</p>

<p>Captain Monk, lifting his hat in return, met him with
cordiality. The field was open to all, he said, but any
friend of Peveril&rsquo;s would be doubly welcome. Peveril
himself was a muff, in so far as that he never hunted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hearing there was to be a meet to-day, I could not
resist the temptation of joining it; it is many years since
I had the opportunity of doing so,&rdquo; remarked the stranger.</p>

<p>There was not time for more, the hounds were throwing
off. Away dashed the Captain&rsquo;s steed, away dashed the
stranger&rsquo;s, away dashed Miss Monk&rsquo;s, the three keeping
side by side.</p>

<p>Presently came a fence. Captain Monk leaped it and
galloped onwards after the other red-coats. Miss Eliza
Monk would have leaped it next, but her horse refused it;
yet he was an old hunter and she a fearless rider. The
stranger was waiting to follow her. A touch of the angry
Monk temper assailed her and she forced her horse to the
leap. He had a temper also; he did not clear it, and horse
and rider came down together.</p>

<p>In a trice Mr. Hamlyn was off his own steed and raising
her. She was not hurt, she said, when she could speak;
a little shaken, a little giddy&mdash;and she leaned against the
fence. The refractory horse, unnoticed for the moment,
got upon his legs, took the fence of his own accord and tore
away after the field. Young Mr. Threpp, who had been in
some difficulty with his own steed, rode up now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I ride back to the Hall and get the pony-carriage
for you, Miss Eliza?&rdquo; asked the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;thank you all the same. I
should prefer to walk home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you equal to walking?&rdquo; interposed the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite. The walk will do away with this faintness. It
is not the first fall I have had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger whispered to young Mr. Threpp&mdash;who was
as good-natured a young fellow as ever lived. Would he
consent to forego the sport that day and lead his horse to
Mr. Peveril&rsquo;s? If so, he would accompany the young lady
and give her the support of his arm.</p>

<p>So William Threpp rode off, leading Mr. Hamlyn&rsquo;s horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and Miss Monk accepted the stranger&rsquo;s arm. He told her
a little about himself as they walked along. It might not
have been an ominous commencement, but intimacies have
grown sometimes out of a slighter introduction. Their
nearest way led past the Vicarage. Mr. Grame saw them
from its windows and came running out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has any accident taken place?&rdquo; he asked hurriedly.
&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eliza Monk&rsquo;s face flushed. He had been Lucy&rsquo;s husband
several months now, but she could not yet suddenly meet
him without a thrill of emotion. Lucy ran out next; the
pretty young wife for whom she had been despised.
Eliza answered Mr. Grame curtly, nodded to Lucy, and
passed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, as I was telling you,&rdquo; continued Mr. Hamlyn,
&ldquo;when this property was left to me in England, I made it
a plea for throwing up my post in India, and came home.
I landed about six weeks ago, and have been since busy in
London with lawyers. Peveril, whom I knew in the days
gone by, wrote to invite me to come to him here on a
week&rsquo;s visit, before he and his wife leave for the South of
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are going to winter there for Mrs. Peveril&rsquo;s health,&rdquo;
observed Eliza. &ldquo;Peacock&rsquo;s Range, the place they live at,
belongs to my cousin, Harry Carradyne. Did I understand
you to say that you were not an Englishman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was born in the West Indies. My family were English
and had settled there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a coincidence!&rdquo; exclaimed Eliza Monk with a
smile. &ldquo;My mother was a West Indian, and I was born
there.&mdash;There&rsquo;s my home, Leet Hall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine old place,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hamlyn, regarding the
mansion before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well say &lsquo;old,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked the young lady.
&ldquo;It has been the abode of the Monk family from generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
to generation. For my part, I sometimes half wish it would
tumble down that we might move to a more lively locality.
Church Leet is a dead-alive place at best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We always want what we have not,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Hamlyn.
&ldquo;I would give all I am worth to possess an ancestral home,
no matter if it were grim and gloomy. We who can boast
of only modern wealth look upon these family castles with
an envy you have little idea of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you possess modern wealth, you possess a very good
and substantial thing,&rdquo; she answered, echoing his laugh.&mdash;&ldquo;Here
comes my aunt, full of wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Full of alarm also. Mrs. Carradyne stood on the terrace
steps, asking if there had been an accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing serious, Aunt Emma. Saladin refused the
fence at Ring Gap, and we both came down together. This
gentleman was so obliging as to forego his day&rsquo;s sport and
escort me home. Mr.&mdash;Mr. Hamlyn, I believe?&rdquo; she
added. &ldquo;My aunt, Mrs. Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger confirmed it. &ldquo;Philip Hamlyn,&rdquo; he said to
Mrs. Carradyne, lifting his hat.</p>

<p>Gaining the hall-door with slow and gentle steps came
a young man, whose beautiful features were wasting more
perceptibly day by day, and their hectic growing of a deeper
crimson. &ldquo;What is wrong, Eliza?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Have you
come to grief? Where&rsquo;s Saladin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; she said to Mr. Hamlyn.</p>

<p>Yes, it was indeed Hubert Monk. For he did not die
of that run to the church the past New Year&rsquo;s Eve. The
death-like faint proved to be a faint, nothing more. Nothing
more <em>then</em>. But something else was advancing with gradual
steps: steps that seemed to be growing almost perceptible
now.</p>

<p>Now and again Hubert fainted in the same manner; his
face taking a death-like hue, the blue tinge surrounding his
mouth. Captain Monk, unable longer to shut his eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
what might be impending, called in the best medical advice
that Worcestershire could afford; and the doctors told him
the truth&mdash;that Hubert&rsquo;s days were numbered.</p>

<p>To say that Captain Monk began at once to &ldquo;set his
house in order&rdquo; would not be quite the right expression,
since it was not he himself who was going to die. But
he set his affairs straight as to the future, and appointed
another heir in his son&rsquo;s place&mdash;his nephew, Harry
Carradyne.</p>

<p>Harry Carradyne, a brave young lieutenant, was then
with his regiment in some almost inaccessible fastness of
the Indian Empire. Captain Monk (not concealing his
lamentation and the cruel grief it was to himself personally)
wrote word to him of the fiat concerning poor Hubert,
together with a peremptory order to sell out and return
home as the future heir. This was being accomplished, and
Harry might now be expected almost any day.</p>

<p>But it may as well be mentioned that Captain Monk,
never given to be confidential about himself or his affairs,
told no one what he had done, with one exception. Even
Mrs. Carradyne was ignorant of the change in her son&rsquo;s
prospects and of his expected return. The one exception
was Hubert. Soon to lose him, Captain Monk made more
of his son than he had ever done, and seemed to like to
talk with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry will make a better master to succeed you than
I should have made, father,&rdquo; said Hubert, as they were
slowly pacing home from the parsonage, arm-in-arm, one
dull November day, some little time after the meet of the
hounds, as recorded. It was surprising how often Captain
Monk would now encounter his son abroad, as if by
accident, and give him his arm home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; wrathfully responded the Captain,
who never liked to hear his own children disparaged, by
themselves or by anyone else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Hubert laughed a little. &ldquo;Harry will look after things
better than I ever should. I was always given to laziness.
Don&rsquo;t you remember, father, when a little boy in the West
Indies, you used to tell me I was good for nothing but to
bask in the heat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember one thing, Hubert; and, strange to say,
have remembered it only lately. Things lie dormant in the
memory for years, and then crop up again. Upon getting
home from one of my long voyages, your mother greeted
me with the news that your heart was weak; the doctor had
told her so. I gave the fellow a trimming for putting so
ridiculous a notion into her head&mdash;and it passed clean out
of mine. I suppose he was right, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little doubt of that, father. I wonder I have lived
so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exploded the Captain; &ldquo;you may live on
yet for years. I don&rsquo;t know that I did not act foolishly in
sending post-haste for Harry Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubert smiled a sad smile. &ldquo;You have done quite right,
father; right in all ways; be sure of that. Harry is one of
the truest and best fellows that ever lived: he will be a
comfort to you when I am gone, and the best of all
successors later. Just&mdash;a&mdash;moment&mdash;father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Captain Monk&mdash;for his
son had suddenly halted and stood with a rapidly-paling
face and shortened breath, pressing his hands to his side.
&ldquo;Here, lean on me, lad; lean on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a sudden faintness. Nothing very much, and it
passed off in a minute or two. Hubert made a brave
attempt at smiling, and resumed his way. But Captain
Monk did not like it at all; he knew all these things were
but the beginning of the end. And that end, though not
with actual irreverence, he was resenting bitterly in his
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that coming out?&rdquo; he asked, crossly, alluding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
some figure descending the steps of his house&mdash;for his sight
was not what it used to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Mr. Hamlyn,&rdquo; said Hubert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Hamlyn! He seems to be always coming in. I
don&rsquo;t like that man somehow, Hubert. Wonder what he&rsquo;s
lagging in the neighbourhood for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubert Monk had an idea that he could have told. But
he did not want to draw down an explosion on his own
head. Mr. Hamlyn came to meet them with friendly
smiles and hand-shakes. Hubert liked him; liked him
very much.</p>

<p>Not only had Mr. Hamlyn prolonged his stay beyond the
&ldquo;day or two&rdquo; he had originally come for, but he evinced
no intention of leaving. When Mr. Peveril and his wife
departed for the south, he made a proposal to remain at
Peacock&rsquo;s Range for a time as their tenant. And when the
astonished couple asked his reasons, he answered that he
should like to get a few runs with the hounds.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The November days glided by. The end of the month
was approaching, and still Philip Hamlyn stayed on, and
was a very frequent visitor at Leet Hall. Little doubt that
Miss Monk was his attraction, and the parish began to say
so without reticence.</p>

<p>The parish was right. One fine, frosty morning Mr.
Hamlyn sought an interview with Captain Monk and laid
before him his proposals for Eliza.</p>

<p>One might have thought by the tempestuous words
showered down upon him in answer that he had proposed
to smother her. Reproaches, hot and fast, were poured
forth upon the suitor&rsquo;s unlucky head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you are a stranger!&rdquo; stormed the Captain; &ldquo;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
have not known her a month! How dare you? It&rsquo;s not
commonly decent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn quietly answered that he had known her
long enough to love her, and went on to say that he came
of a good family, had plenty of money, and could make
a liberal settlement upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you never will,&rdquo; said Captain Monk. &ldquo;I should
not like you for my son-in-law,&rdquo; he continued candidly,
calming down from his burst of passion to the bounds of
reason. &ldquo;But there can be no question of it in any way.
Eliza is to become Lady Rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn opened his eyes in astonishment. &ldquo;Lady
Rivers!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Do you speak of Sir Thomas
Rivers?&mdash;that old man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not, sir. Sir Thomas Rivers has one foot in
the grave. I speak of his eldest son. He wants her, and
he shall have her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Captain, I&mdash;I do not think Miss Monk can
know anything of this. I am sure she did not last night.
I come to you with her full consent and approbation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care nothing about that. My daughter is aware that
any attempt to oppose her will to mine would be utterly
futile. Young Tom Rivers has written to me to ask for
her; I have accepted him, and I choose that she shall
accept him. She&rsquo;ll like it herself, too; it will be a good
match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Tom Rivers is next door to a simpleton: he is
not half-baked,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Hamlyn, his own temper
getting up: &ldquo;if I may judge by what I&rsquo;ve seen of him in
the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Rivers is a favourite everywhere, let me tell you,
sir. Eliza would not refuse him for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Captain Monk, you will converse with her
upon this point?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to give her my orders&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
mean,&rdquo; returned the Captain. &ldquo;And now, sir, I think our
discussion may terminate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn saw no use in prolonging it for the present.
Captain Monk bowed him out of the house and called his
daughter into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo; he began, scorning to beat about the bush, &ldquo;I
have received an offer of marriage for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Eliza blushed a little, not much: few things could
make her do that now. Once our blushes have been
wasted, as hers were on Robert Grame, their vivid freshness
has faded for ever and aye. &ldquo;The song has left the bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have accepted it,&rdquo; continued Captain Monk.
&ldquo;He would like the wedding to be early in the year, so you
may get your rattle-traps in order for it. Tell your aunt I
will give her a blank cheque for the cost, and she may
fill it in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the letter; you can read it&rdquo;&mdash;pushing one
across the table to her. &ldquo;It came by special messenger
last night, and I have sent my answer this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eliza Monk glanced at the contents, which were written
on rose-coloured paper. For a moment she looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, papa, this is from Tom Rivers! You cannot
suppose I would marry <em>him</em>! A silly boy, younger than
I am! Tom Rivers is the greatest goose I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you say so, Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he is. Look at his note! Pink paper and a
fancy edge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff! Rivers is young and inexperienced, but he&rsquo;ll
grow older&mdash;he is a very nice young fellow, and a capital
fox-hunter. You&rsquo;d be master and mistress too&mdash;and that
would suit your book, I take it. I want to have you settled
near me, Eliza&mdash;you are all I have left, or soon will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, papa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Monk raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent that man Hamlyn to me with a proposal for
you. Eliza; you <em>know</em> that would not do. Hamlyn&rsquo;s
property lies in the West Indies, his home too, for all I
know. He attempted to tell me that he would not take
you out there against my consent; but I know better, and
what such ante-nuptial promises are worth. It might end
in your living there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say &lsquo;no, no&rsquo; for, like a parrot? Circumstances
might compel you. I do not like the man, besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I have never liked him from the first.
There! that&rsquo;s enough. You must be my Lady Rivers.
Poor old Tom is on his last legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, I never will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Eliza. I had one trouble with Katherine; I
will not have another with you. She defied me; she
left my home rebelliously to enter upon one of her own
setting-up: what came of it? Did luck attend her? Do
you be more wise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, moving a step forward with head
uplifted; and the resolute, haughty look which rendered
their faces so much alike was very conspicuous on hers,
&ldquo;do not let us oppose each other. Perhaps we can each
give way a little? I have promised to be the wife of Philip
Hamlyn, and that promise I will fulfil. You wish me to
live near you: well, he can take a place in this neighbourhood
and settle down in it; and on my part, I will promise
you not to leave this country. He may have to go from
time to time to the West Indies; I will remain at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk looked steadily at her before he answered.
He marked the stern, uncompromising expression, the
strong will in the dark eyes and in every feature, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
no power, not even his, might unbend. He thought of his
elder daughter, now lying in her grave; he thought of his
son, so soon to be lying beside her; he did not care to be
bereft of <em>all</em> his children, and for once in his hard life he
attempted to conciliate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark to me, Eliza. Give up Hamlyn&mdash;I have said
I don&rsquo;t like the man; give up Tom Rivers also, as you
will. Remain at home with me until a better suitor shall
present himself, and Leet Hall and its broad lands shall
be yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up in surprise. Leet Hall had always hitherto
gone in the male line; and, failing Hubert, it would be, or
ought to be, Harry Carradyne&rsquo;s. Though she knew not
that any steps had already been taken in that direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leet Hall?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leet Hall and its broad lands,&rdquo; repeated the Captain
impatiently. &ldquo;Give up Mr. Hamlyn and it shall all be
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remained for some moments in deep thought, her
head bent, revolving the offer. She was fond of pomp and
power, as her father had ever been, and the temptation to
rule as sole domineering mistress in her girlhood&rsquo;s home
was great. But at that very instant the tall fine form of
Philip Hamlyn passed across a pathway in the distance,
and she turned from the temptation for ever. What little
capability of loving had been left to her after the advent of
Robert Grame was given to Mr. Hamlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot give him up,&rdquo; she said in low tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What moonshine, Eliza! You are not a love-sick girl
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour dyed her face painfully. Did her father
suspect aught of the past; of where her love <em>had</em> been
given&mdash;and rejected? The suspicion only added fuel to
the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot give up Mr. Hamlyn,&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will never inherit Leet Hall. No, nor aught
else of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please, sir, about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You set me at defiance, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to do so, father; but I shall marry Mr.
Hamlyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At defiance,&rdquo; repeated the Captain, as she moved to
escape from his presence; &ldquo;Katherine secretly, you openly.
Better that I had never had children. Look here, Eliza:
let this matter remain in abeyance for six or twelve months,
things resting as they are. By that time you may have
come to your senses; or I (yes, I see you are ready to
retort it) to mine. If not&mdash;well, we shall only then be
where we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that we should be,&rdquo; returned Eliza, doggedly.
&ldquo;Time will never change either of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But events may. Let it be so, child. Stay where you
are for the present, in your maiden home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head in denial; not a line of her proud
face giving way, nor a curve of her decisive lips: and
Captain Monk knew that he had pleaded in vain. She
would neither give up her marriage nor prolong the period
for its celebration.</p>

<p>What could be the secret of her obstinacy? Chiefly the
impossibility of tolerating opposition to her own indomitable
will. It was her father&rsquo;s will over again; his might be a
very little softening with years and trouble; not much.
Had she been in desperate love with Hamlyn one could
have understood it, but she was not; at most it was but a
passing fancy. What says the poet? I daresay you all
know the lines, and I know I have quoted them times and
again, they are so true:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Few hearts have never loved, but fewer still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have felt a second passion. <em>None</em> a third.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first was living fire; the next a thrill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weary heart can never more be stirred:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rely on it the song has left the bird.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Very, very true. Her passion for Robert Grame had
been as living fire in its wild intensity; it was but the
shadow of a thrill that warmed her heart for Philip Hamlyn.
Possibly she mistook it in a degree; thought more of it
than it was. The feeling of gratification which arises from
flattered vanity deceives a woman&rsquo;s heart sometimes: and
Mr. Hamlyn did not conceal his rapturous admiration of
her.</p>

<p>She held to her defiant course, and her father held to
his. He did not continue to say she should not marry; he
had no power for that&mdash;and perhaps he did not want her
to make a moonlight escapade of it, as Katherine had
made. So the preparation for the wedding went on, Eliza
herself paying for the rattletraps, as they had been called;
Captain Monk avowed that he &ldquo;washed his hands of it,&rdquo;
and then held his peace.</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Hamlyn and his intended bride considered
it best to get the wedding over and done with, lest adverse
fate, set afoot by the Captain, should after all circumvent
them, it is impossible to say, but the day fixed was a speedy
one. And if Captain Monk had deemed it &ldquo;not decent&rdquo;
in Mr. Hamlyn to propose for a young lady after only a
month&rsquo;s knowledge, what did he think of this? They were
to be married on the last day of the year.</p>

<p>Was it fixed upon in defiant mockery?&mdash;for, as the
reader knows, it had proved an ominous day more than
once in the Monk family. But no, defiance had no hand
in that, simply adverse fate. The day originally fixed by
the happy couple was Christmas Eve: but Mr. Hamlyn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
who had to go to London about that time on business connected
with his property, found it impossible to get back
for the day, or for some days after it. He wrote to Eliza,
asking that the day should be put off for a week, if it made
no essential difference, and fixed the last day in the year.
Eliza wrote word back that she would prefer that day; it
gave more time for preparation.</p>

<p>They were to be married in her own church, and by its
Vicar. Great marvel existed at the Captain&rsquo;s permitting
this, but he said nothing. Having washed his hands of the
affair, he washed them for good: had the bride been one
of the laundry-maids in his household he could not have
taken less notice. A Miss Wilson was coming from a little
distance to be bridesmaid; and the bride and bridegroom
would go off from the church door. The question of a
breakfast was never mooted: Captain Monk&rsquo;s equable indifference
might not have stood that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall wish them good luck with all my heart&mdash;but I
don&rsquo;t feel altogether sure they&rsquo;ll have it!&rdquo; bewailed poor
Mrs. Carradyne in private. &ldquo;Eliza should have agreed to
the delay proposed by her father.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Ring, ring, ring, broke forth the chimes on the frosty
midday air. Not midnight, you perceive, but midday, for
the church clock had just given forth its twelve strokes.
Another round of the dial, and the old year would have
departed into the womb of the past.</p>

<p>Bowling along the smooth turnpike road which skirted
the churchyard on one side came a gig containing a gentleman,
a tall, slender, frank-looking young man, with a fair
face and the pleasantest blue eyes ever seen. He wore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
white top-coat, the fashion then, and was driving rapidly in
the direction of Leet Hall; but when the chimes burst forth
he pulled up abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began&mdash;and then
sat still listening to the sweet strains of &ldquo;The Bay of
Biscay.&rdquo; The day, though in mid-winter, was bright and
beautiful, and the golden sunlight, shining from the dark-blue
sky, played on the young man&rsquo;s golden hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they mistaken midday for midnight?&rdquo; he continued,
as the chimes played out their tune and died away
on the air. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, Harry Carradyne, was not the only one to ask this.
No human being in and about Church Leet, save Captain
Monk and they who executed his orders, knew that he had
decreed that the chimes should play that day at midday.
Why did he do it? What could his motive be? Surely
not that they should, by playing (according to Mrs. Carradyne&rsquo;s
theory), inaugurate ill-luck for Eliza! At the
moment they began to play she was coming out of church
on Mr. Hamlyn&rsquo;s arm, having left her maiden name
behind her.</p>

<p>A few paces more, for he was driving gently on now, and
Harry pulled up again, in surprise, as before, for the front
of the church was now in view. Lots of spectators, gentle
and simple, stood about, and a handsome chariot, with four
post-horses and a great coat-of-arms emblazoned on its
panels, waited at the church gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be a wedding!&rdquo; decided Harry.</p>

<p>The next moment the chariot was in motion; was soon
about to pass him, the bride and bridegroom within it. A
very dark but good-looking man, with an air of command
in his face, he, but a stranger to Harry; she, Eliza. She
wore a grey silk dress, a white bonnet, with orange blossoms
and a veil, which was quite the fashionable wedding attire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of the day. Her head was turned, nodding its farewells yet
to the crowd, and she did not see her cousin as the chariot
swept by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, mentally. &ldquo;I wonder who
she has married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staying quietly where he was until the spectators should
have dispersed, whose way led them mostly in opposite
directions, Harry next saw the clerk come out of the church
by the small vestry door, lock it and cross over to the stile:
which brought him out close to the gig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my heart alive!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it Captain
Carradyne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s near enough,&rdquo; said Harry, who knew the title
was accorded him by the rustic natives of Church Leet, as
he bent down with his sunny smile to shake the old clerk&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;You are hearty as ever, I see, John. And so you
have had a wedding here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, there have been one in the church. I was not
in my place, though. The Captain, he ordered me to let
the church go for once, and to be ready up aloft in the
belfry to set the chimes going at midday. As chance had
it, the party came out just at the same time; Miss Eliza
was a bit late in coming, ye see; so it may be said the
chimes rang &rsquo;em out. I guess the sound astonished the
people above a bit, for nobody knew they were going to
play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how was it all, Cale? Why should the Captain
order them to chime at midday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Cale shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell ye that rightly,
Mr. Harry; the Captain, as ye know, sir, never says why
he does this or why he does t&rsquo;other. Young William
Threpp, who had to be up there with me, thought he must
have ordered &rsquo;em to play in mockery&mdash;for he hates the
marriage like poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the bridegroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Mr. Hamlyn, sir. A gentleman who is pretty
nigh as haughty as the Captain himself; but a pleasant-spoken,
kindly man, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen: and a rich one,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did Captain Monk object to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thought &rsquo;twas because he was a stranger to the
place and has lived over in the Indies; and he wanted
Miss Eliza, so it&rsquo;s said, to have young Tom Rivers. That&rsquo;s
about it, I b&rsquo;lieve, Mr. Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry Carradyne drove away thoughtfully. At the foot
of the slight ascent leading to Leet Hall, one of the grooms
happened to be standing. Harry handed over to him the
horse and gig, and went forward on foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bertie!&rdquo; he called out. For he had seen Hubert
before him, walking at a snail&rsquo;s pace: the very slightest
hill tried him now. The only one left of the wedding-party,
for the bridesmaid drove off from the church door.
Hubert turned at the call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry! Why, Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hand locked in hand, they sat down on a bench beside
the path; face gazing into face. There had always been a
likeness between them: in the bright-coloured, waving hair,
the blue eyes and the well-favoured features. But Harry&rsquo;s
face was redolent of youth and health; in the other&rsquo;s might
be read approaching death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very thin, Bertie; thinner even than I expected
to see you,&rdquo; broke from the traveller involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> are looking well, at any rate,&rdquo; was Hubert&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;And I am so glad you are come: I thought you might
have been here a month ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The voyage was unreasonably long; we had contrary
winds almost from port to port. I got on to Worcester
yesterday, slept there, and hired a horse and gig to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
me over this morning. What about Eliza&rsquo;s wedding,
Hubert? I was just in time to see her drive away. Cale,
with whom I had a word down yonder, says the master
does not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not like it and would not countenance it:
washed his hands of it (as he told us) altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any good reason for that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not particularly good, that I see. Somehow he disliked
Hamlyn; and Tom Rivers wanted Eliza, which would
have pleased him greatly. But Eliza was not without
blame. My father gave way so far as to ask her to delay
things for a few months, not to marry in haste, and she
would not. She might have conceded as much as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know Eliza concede anything, Bertie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who gave her away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did: look at my gala toggery&rdquo;&mdash;opening his overcoat.
&ldquo;He wanted to forbid it. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hinder me, father,&rsquo;
I pleaded; &lsquo;it is the last brotherly service I can ever render
her.&rsquo; And so,&rdquo; his tone changing to lightness, &ldquo;I have been
and gone and done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry Carradyne understood. &ldquo;Not the last, Hubert;
don&rsquo;t say that. I hope you will live to render her many
another yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubert smiled faintly. &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he said in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; I see how you look. But you may take
a turn yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, miracles are no longer wrought for us. Shall I
surprise you very much, cousin mine, if I say that were the
offer made me of prolonged life, I am not sure that I
should accept it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless health were renewed with it; I can understand
that. You have had to endure suffering, Bertie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. Pain, discomfort, fears, weariness. After working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
out their torment upon me, they&mdash;why then they took a
turn and opened out the vista of a refuge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A refuge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one sure Refuge offered by God to the sick and
sorrowful, the weary and heavy-laden&mdash;Himself. I found
it. I found <em>Him</em> and all His wonderful mercy. It will
not be long now, Harry, before I see Him face to face.
And here comes His true minister, but for whom I might
have missed the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry turned his head, and saw, advancing up the drive,
a good-looking young clergyman. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he
involuntarily cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother-in-law, Robert Grame. Lucy&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the fashion in those days for a bride&rsquo;s mother
(or one acting as her mother) to attend the bride to church;
therefore Mrs. Carradyne, following it, was spared risk of
conflict with Captain Monk on that score. She was in
Eliza&rsquo;s room, assisting at the putting on of the bridal robes
(for we have to go back an hour or so) when a servant came
up to say that Mr. Hamlyn waited below. Rather wondering&mdash;for
he was to have driven straight to the church&mdash;Mrs.
Carradyne went downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, dear Mrs. Carradyne,&rdquo; he said, as he shook
hands, and she had never seen him look so handsome, &ldquo;I
could not pass the house without making one more effort
to disarm Captain Monk&rsquo;s prejudices, and asking for his
blessing on us. Do you think he will consent to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne felt sure he would not, and said so. But
she sent Rimmer to the library to ask the question. Mr.
Hamlyn pencilled down a few anxious words on paper,
folded it, and put it into the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>No; it proved useless. Captain Monk was harder than
adamant; he sent Rimmer back with a flea in his ear, and
the petition torn in two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I feared so,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Carradyne. &ldquo;He will not
this morning see even Eliza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn did not sigh in return; he spoke a cross,
impatient word: he had never been able to see reason
in the Captain&rsquo;s dislike to him, and, with a brief good-morning,
went out to his carriage. But, remembering
something when crossing the hall, he came back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Mrs. Carradyne; I quite forgot that I have
a note for you. It is from Mrs. Peveril, I believe; it came
to me this morning, enclosed in a letter of her husband&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard at last, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last&mdash;as you observe. Though Peveril had nothing
particular to write about; I daresay he does not care for
letter writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slipping the note into her pocket, to be opened at leisure,
Mrs. Carradyne returned to the adorning of Eliza. Somehow,
it was rather a prolonged business&mdash;which made it late
when the bride with her bridesmaid and Hubert drove from
the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne remained in the room&mdash;to which Eliza
was not to return&mdash;putting up this, and that. The time
slipped on, and it was close upon twelve o&rsquo;clock when she
got back to the drawing-room. Captain Monk was in it
then, standing at the window, which he had thrown wide
open. To see more clearly the bridal party come out of
church, was the thought that crossed Mrs. Carradyne&rsquo;s
mind in her simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I very much feared they would be late,&rdquo; she observed,
sitting down near her brother: and at that moment the
church clock began to strike twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing if they were <em>too</em> late!&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She supposed he wanted to count the strokes&mdash;what else
could he be listening to? And now, by the stir at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
distant gates, she saw that the bridal party had come
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Carradyne,
starting from her chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chimes,&rdquo; stoically replied the Captain. And he
proceeded to hum through the tune of &ldquo;The Bay of Biscay,&rdquo;
and beat a noiseless accompaniment with his foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Chimes</em>, Emma,&rdquo; he repeated, when the melody had
finished itself out. &ldquo;I ordered them to be played. It&rsquo;s the
last day of the old year, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing slightly at her consternation, Captain Monk
closed the window and quitted the room. As Mrs. Carradyne
took her handkerchief from her pocket to pass it over
her face, grown white with startled terror, the note she had
put there came out also, and fell on the carpet.</p>

<p>Picking it up, she stood at the window, gazing forth. Her
sight was not what it used to be; but she discerned the
bride and bridegroom enter their carriage and drive away;
next she saw the bridesmaid get into the carriage from the
Hall, assisted by Hubert, and that drive off in its turn. She
saw the crowd disperse, this way and that; she even saw the
gig there, its occupant talking with John Cale. But she did
not look at him particularly; and she had not the slightest
idea but that Harry was in India.</p>

<p>And all that time an undercurrent of depression was
running riot in her heart. None knew with what a strange
terror she had grown to dread the chimes.</p>

<p>She sat down now and opened Mrs. Peveril&rsquo;s note. It
treated chiefly of the utterly astounding ways that untravelled
old lady was meeting with in foreign parts. &ldquo;If you will
believe me,&rdquo; wrote she, &ldquo;the girl that waits on us wears
carpet slippers down at heel, and a short cotton jacket
for best, and she puts the tea-tray before me with the handle
of the tea-pot turned to me and the spout standing outwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
and she comes right into the bed-room of a morning with
Charles&rsquo;s shaving-water without knocking.&rdquo; But the one
sentence that arrested Mrs. Carradyne&rsquo;s attention above any
other was the following: &ldquo;I reckon that by this time you
have grown well acquainted with our esteemed young friend.
He is a good, kindly gentleman, and I&rsquo;m sure never could
have done anything to deserve his wife&rsquo;s treatment of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can she mean Mr. Hamlyn?&rdquo; debated Mrs. Carradyne,
all sorts of ideas leaping into her mind with a rush. &ldquo;If
not&mdash;what other &lsquo;esteemed friend&rsquo; can she allude to?&mdash;<em>she</em>,
old herself, would call <em>him</em> young. But Mr. Hamlyn has
not any wife. At least, had not until to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She read the note over again. She sat with it open,
buried in a reverie, thinking no end of things, good and
bad: and the conclusion she at last came to was, that,
with the unwonted exercise of letter-writing, poor old Mrs.
Peveril&rsquo;s head had grown confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hubert, did it all go off well?&rdquo; she questioned, as
her nephew entered the room, some sort of excitement on
his wasted face. &ldquo;I saw them drive away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it went off well; there was no hitch anywhere,&rdquo;
replied Hubert. &ldquo;But, Aunt Emma, I have brought a
friend home with me. Guess who it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some lady or other who came to see the wedding,&rdquo; she
returned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never would, though I were to give you ten
guesses; no, though je vous donne en mille, as the French
have it. What should you say to a young man come all the
way over seas from India? There, that&rsquo;s as good as telling
you, Aunt Emma. Guess now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hubert!&rdquo; clasping her trembling hands. &ldquo;It
cannot be Harry! What is wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry brought his bright face into the room and was
clasped in his mother&rsquo;s arms. She could not understand it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
one bit, and fears assailed her. Come home in <em>this</em> unexpected
manner! Had he left the army? What had he
done? <em>What</em> had he done? Hubert laughed and told
her then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has done nothing wrong; everything that&rsquo;s good.
He has sold out at my father&rsquo;s request and left with honours&mdash;and
is come home the heir of Leet Hall. I said all along
it was a shame to keep you out of the plot, Aunt Emma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, it was glorious news for her. But, as if to tarnish
its delight, like an envious sprite of evil, deep down in her
mind lay that other news, just read&mdash;the ambiguous remark
of old Mrs. Peveril&rsquo;s.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The walk on the old pier was pleasant enough in the
morning sun. Though yet but the first month in the year,
the days were bright, the blue skies without a cloud. Mr.
and Mrs. Hamlyn had enjoyed the fine weather at Cheltenham
for a week or two; from that pretty place they had
now come to Brighton, reaching it the previous night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is delightful!&rdquo; exclaimed Eliza, gazing at the
waves. She had not seen the sea since she crossed it, a
little girl, from the West Indies. Those were not yet the
days when all people, gentle and simple, told one another
that an autumn tour was essential to existence. &ldquo;Look at
the sunbeams sparkling on the ripples and on the white sails
of the little boats! Philip, I should like to spend a month
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hamlyn.</p>

<p>They were staying at the Old Ship, a fashionable hotel
then for ladies as well as gentlemen, and had come out
after breakfast; and they had the pier nearly to themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
at that early hour. A yellow, gouty gentleman, who looked
as if he had quarrelled with his liver in some clime all fire
and cayenne, stood at the end leaning on his stick, alternately
looking at the sea and listlessly watching any
advancing stragglers.</p>

<p>There came a sailor, swaying along, a rope in his hand;
following him, walked demurely three little girls in frocks
and trousers, with their French governess; then came two
eye-glassed young men, dandified and supercilious, who
appeared to have more money than brains&mdash;and the jaundiced
man went into a gaping fit of lassitude.</p>

<p>Anyone else coming? Yes; a lady and gentleman arm-in-arm:
quiet, well-dressed, good-looking. As the invalid
watched their approach, a puzzled look of doubt and surprise
rose to his countenance. Moving forward a step or two
on his gouty legs, he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible, Hamlyn, that we meet here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even through his dark skin a red flush coursed into Mr.
Hamlyn&rsquo;s face. He was evidently very much surprised in
his turn, if not startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Pratt!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Pratt now,&rdquo; was the answer, as they shook hands.
&ldquo;That wretched climate played the deuce with me, and
they graciously gave me a step and allowed me to retire
upon it. The very deuce, I assure you, Philip. Beg
pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he added, seeing the lady look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife, Mrs. Hamlyn,&rdquo; spoke her husband.</p>

<p>Major Pratt contrived to lift his hat, and bow: which feat,
what with his gouty hands and his helpless legs and his great
invalid stick, was a work of time. &ldquo;I saw your marriage in
the <cite>Times</cite>, Hamlyn, and wondered whether it could be you,
or not: I didn&rsquo;t know, you see, that you were over here.
Wish you luck; and you also, ma&rsquo;am. Hope it will turn
out more fortunate for you, Philip, than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo; broke in Mr. Hamlyn, as if
something were frightening him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At some lodgings over yonder, where they fleece me,&rdquo;
replied the Major. &ldquo;You should see the bill they&rsquo;ve brought
me in for last week. They&rsquo;ve made me eat four pounds of
butter and five joints of meat, besides poultry and pickles
and a fruit pie! Why, I live mostly upon dry toast; hardly
dare touch an ounce of meat in a day. When I had &rsquo;em
up before me, the harpies, they laid it upon my servant&rsquo;s
appetite&mdash;old Saul, you know. <em>He</em> answered them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn laughed. &ldquo;There are two articles that are
very convenient, as I have heard, to some of the lodging-house
keepers: their lodgers&rsquo; servant, and their own cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, ma&rsquo;am, yes!&rdquo; said the Major. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve
given warning to this lot where I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying au revoir to Major Pratt, Mr. Hamlyn walked
down the pier again with his wife. &ldquo;Who is he, Philip?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;You seem to know him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. He is a sort of connection of mine, I
believe,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Hamlyn, &ldquo;and I saw a good deal of
him in India a few years back. He is greatly changed. I
hardly think I should have known him had he not spoken.
It&rsquo;s his liver, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving his wife at the hotel, Mr. Hamlyn went back
again to Major Pratt, much to the lonely Major&rsquo;s satisfaction,
who was still leaning on his substantial stick as he
gazed at the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sight of you has brought back to my mind all that
unhappy business, Hamlyn,&rdquo; was his salutation. &ldquo;I shall
have a fit of the jaundice now, I suppose! Here&mdash;let&rsquo;s sit
down a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the sight of you has brought it to mine,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hamlyn, as he complied. &ldquo;I have been striving to drive it
out of my remembrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know little about it,&rdquo; observed the Major. &ldquo;She
never wrote to me at all afterwards, and you wrote me but
two letters: the one announcing the fact of her disgrace;
the other, the calamity and the deaths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite enough to know; don&rsquo;t ask me to go over
the details to you personally,&rdquo; said Mr. Hamlyn in a tone of
passionate discomfort. &ldquo;So utterly repugnant to me is the
remembrance altogether, that I have never spoken of it&mdash;even
to my present wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;ve not told her you were once a
married man?&rdquo; cried Major Pratt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve shown a lack of judgment which I wouldn&rsquo;t
have given you credit for, my friend,&rdquo; declared the Major.
&ldquo;A man may whisper to his girl any untoward news he
pleases of his past life, and she&rsquo;ll forgive and forget; aye,
and worship him all the more for it, though it were the
having set fire to a church: but if he keeps it as a bonne
bouchée to drop out after marriage, when she has him fast
and tight, she&rsquo;ll curry-comb his hair for him in style. Believe
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There never was a hidden skeleton between man and
wife yet but it came to light sooner or later,&rdquo; went on the
Major. &ldquo;If you are wise, you will tell her at once, before
somebody else does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What &lsquo;somebody?&rsquo; Who is there here that knows it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, as to &lsquo;here,&rsquo; I know it, and nearly spoke of it
before her, as you must have heard; and my servant knows
it. That&rsquo;s nothing, you&rsquo;ll say; we can be quiet, now I have
the cue: but you are always liable to meet with people who
knew you in those days, and who knew <em>her</em>. Take my
advice, Philip Hamlyn, and tell your wife. Go and do it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay you are right,&rdquo; said the younger man, awaking
out of a reverie. &ldquo;Of the two evils it may be the lesser.&rdquo;
And with lagging steps, and eyes that seemed to have
weights to them, he set out to walk back to the Old Ship
Hotel.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE SILENT CHIMES</h2>


<h3>IV.&mdash;NOT HEARD</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>That oft-quoted French saying, a mauvais-quart-d&rsquo;heure, is
a pregnant one, and may apply to small as well as to great
worries of life: most of us know it to our cost. But, rely
upon it, one of the very worst is that when a bride or bridegroom
has to make a disagreeable confession to the other,
which ought to have been made before going to church.</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn was finding it so. Standing over the fire,
in their sitting-room at the Old Ship Hotel at Brighton, his
elbow on the mantelpiece, his hand shading his eyes, he
looked down at his wife sitting opposite him, and disclosed
his tale: that when he married her fifteen days ago he had
not been a bachelor, but a widower. There was no especial
reason for his not having told her, save that he hated and
abhorred that earlier period of his life and instinctively
shunned its remembrance.</p>

<p>Sent to India by his friends in the West Indies to make
his way in the world, he entered one of the most important
mercantile houses in Calcutta, purchasing a lucrative post
in it. Mixing in the best society, for his introductions were
undeniable, he in course of time met with a young lady
named Pratt, who had come out from England to stay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
her elderly cousins, Captain Pratt and his sister. Philip
Hamlyn was caught by her pretty doll&rsquo;s face, and married
her. They called her Dolly: and a doll she was, by nature
as well as by name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry in haste and repent at leisure,&rdquo; is as true a
saying as the French one. Philip Hamlyn found it so. Of
all vain, frivolous, heartless women, Mrs. Dolly Hamlyn
turned out to be about the worst. Just a year or two of
uncomfortable bickering, of vain endeavours on his part,
now coaxing, now reproaching, to make her what she was
not and never would be&mdash;a reasonable woman, a sensible
wife&mdash;and Dolly Hamlyn fled. She decamped with a
hair-brained lieutenant, the two taking sailing-ship for
England, and she carrying with her her little one-year-old
boy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you to guess what Philip Hamlyn&rsquo;s sensations
were. A calamity such as that does not often fall upon
man. While he was taking steps to put his wife legally
away for ever and to get back his child, and Captain
Pratt was aiding and abetting (and swearing frightfully at
the delinquent over the process), news reached them that
Heaven&rsquo;s vengeance had been more speedy than theirs.
The ship, driven out of her way by contrary winds and
other disasters, went down off the coast of Spain, and all
the passengers on board perished. This was what Philip
Hamlyn had to confess now: and it was more than silly
of him not to have done it before.</p>

<p>He touched but lightly upon it now. His tones were
low, his words when he began somewhat confused: nevertheless
his wife, gazing up at him with her large dark eyes,
gathered an inkling of his meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell it me!&rdquo; she passionately interrupted. &ldquo;Do
not tell me that I am only your second wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went over to her, praying her to be calm, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of the bitter feeling of shame which had ever since clung
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you divorce her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; you do not understand me, Eliza. She died
before anything could be done; the ship was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were there any children?&rdquo; she asked in a hard
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One; a baby of a year old. He was drowned with his
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn folded her hands one over the other, and
leaned back in her chair. &ldquo;Why did you deceive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My will was good to deceive you for ever,&rdquo; he confessed
with emotion. &ldquo;I hate that past episode in my
life; hate to think of it: I wish I could blot it out of
remembrance. But for Pratt I should not have told you
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he said you ought to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did: and blamed me for not having told you
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any more secrets of the past that you are
keeping from me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. Not one. You may take my honour upon it,
Eliza. And now let us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had started forward in her chair; a red flush
darkening her pale cheeks. &ldquo;Philip! Philip! am I legally
married? Did you describe yourself as a <em>bachelor</em> in the
license?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, as a widower. I got the license in London, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no one read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one save he who married us: Robert Grame, and
I don&rsquo;t suppose he noticed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Grame! The flush on Eliza&rsquo;s cheeks grew
deeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you <em>love</em> her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I thought so when I married her. It did
not take long to disenchant me,&rdquo; he added with a harsh
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was her Christian name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dolly. Dora, I believe, by register. My dear wife, I
have told you all. In compassion to me let us drop the
subject, now and for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was Eliza Hamlyn&mdash;sitting there with pale, compressed
lips, sullen eyes, and hands interlocked in pain&mdash;already
beginning to reap the fruit she had sown as Eliza Monk by
her rebellious marriage? Perhaps so. But not as she
would have to reap it later on.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hamlyn spent nearly all that year in
travelling. In September they came to Peacock&rsquo;s Range,
taking it furnished for a term of old Mr. and Mrs. Peveril,
who had not yet come back to it. It stood midway, as
may be remembered, between Church Leet and Church
Dykely, so that Eliza was close to her old home. Late in
October a little boy was born: it would be hard to say
which was the prouder of him, Philip Hamlyn or his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you like his name to be?&rdquo; Philip asked
her one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like it to be Walter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hamlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Walter!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I like the name to begin with, but I once had
a dear little brother named Walter, just a year younger
than I. He died before we came home to England. Have
you any objection to the name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no objection,&rdquo; he slowly said. &ldquo;I was only
thinking whether you would have any. It was the name
given to my first child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can make no possible difference&mdash;it was not my
child,&rdquo; was her haughty answer. So the baby was named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Walter James; the latter name also chosen by Eliza, because
it had been old Mr. Monk&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In the following spring Mr. Hamlyn had to go to the
West Indies. Eliza remained at home; and during this
time she became reconciled to her father.</p>

<p>Hubert brought it about. For Hubert lived yet. But he
was a mere shadow and had to take entirely to the house,
and soon to his room. Eliza came to see him, again and
again; and finally over Hubert&rsquo;s sofa peace was made&mdash;for
Captain Monk loved her still, just as he had loved Katherine,
for all her rebellion.</p>

<p>Hubert lingered on to the summer. And then, on a calm
evening, when one of the glorious sunsets that he had so
loved to look upon was illumining the western sky, opening
up to his dying view, as he had once said, the very portals
of Heaven, he passed peacefully away to his rest.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The next change that set in at Leet Hall concerned Miss
Kate Dancox. That wilful young pickle, somewhat sobered
by the death of Hubert in the summer, soon grew unbearable
again. She had completely got the upper hand of her
morning governess, Miss Hume&mdash;who walked all the way
from Church Dykely and back again&mdash;and of nearly everyone
else; and Captain Monk gave forth his decision one
day when all was turbulence&mdash;a resident governess. Mrs.
Carradyne could have danced a reel for joy, and wrote to a
governess agency in London.</p>

<p>One morning about this time (which was already glowing
with the tints of autumn) a young lady got out of an omnibus
in Oxford Street, which had brought her from a western
suburb of London, paid the conductor, and then looked
about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a quaint tone of vexation,
&ldquo;I have to cross the street! and how am I to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently she was not used to the bustle of London
streets or to crossing them alone. She did it, however,
after a few false starts, and so turned down a quiet side
street and rang the bell of a house in it. A slatternly girl
answered the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Governess-agent&mdash;Mrs. Moffit? Oh, yes; first-floor
front,&rdquo; said she crustily, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The young lady found her way upstairs alone. Mrs.
Moffit sat in state in a big arm-chair, before a large table
and desk, whence she daily dispensed joy or despair to her
applicants. Several opened letters and copies of the daily
journals lay on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried she, laying down her pen, &ldquo;what for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here by your appointment, made with me a
week ago,&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;This is Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Moffit sharply, turning over
rapidly the leaves of a ledger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss West. If you remember, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, child, my memory&rsquo;s good enough,&rdquo; was the tart
interruption. &ldquo;But with so many applicants it&rsquo;s impossible
to be certain as to faces. Registered names we can&rsquo;t
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Moffit read her notes&mdash;taken down a week ago.
&ldquo;Miss West. Educated in first-class school at Richmond;
remained in it as teacher. Very good references from the
ladies keeping it. Father, Colonel in India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not wish to go into a school again?&rdquo; spoke
Mrs. Moffit, closing the ledger with a snap, and peremptorily
drowning what the applicant was about to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no, I am only leaving to better myself, as the
maids say,&rdquo; replied the young lady, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you wish for a good salary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can get it. One does not care to work hard for
next to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else I have&mdash;let me see&mdash;two&mdash;three situations on
my books. Very comfortable, I am instructed, but two of
them offer ten pounds a-year, the other twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young lady drew herself slightly up with an involuntary
movement. &ldquo;Quite impossible, madam, that I could
take any one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Moffit picked up a letter and consulted it, looking
at the young lady from time to time, as if taking stock of
her appearance. &ldquo;I received a letter this morning from the
country&mdash;a family require a well-qualified governess for their
one little girl. Your testimonials as to qualifications might
suit&mdash;and you are, I believe, a gentlewoman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; my father was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I remember&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got it down; don&rsquo;t worry
me,&rdquo; impatiently spoke the oracle, cutting short the interruption.
&ldquo;So far you might suit: but in other respects&mdash;I
hardly know what to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked the other timidly, blushing a little
under the intent gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are very young, for one thing; and they might
think you too good-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s blush grew red as a rose; she had delicate
features and it made her look uncommonly pretty. A half-smile
sat in her soft, dark hazel eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely that could not be an impediment. I am not so
good-looking as all that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as people may think,&rdquo; was the significant answer.
&ldquo;Some families will not take a pretty governess&mdash;afraid of
their sons, you see. This family says nothing about looks;
for aught I know there may be no sons in it. &lsquo;Thoroughly
competent&rsquo;&mdash;reading from the letter&mdash;&lsquo;a gentlewoman by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
birth, of agreeable manners and lady-like. Salary, first
year, to be forty pounds.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you not recommend me?&rdquo; pleaded the young
governess, her voice full of entreaty. &ldquo;Oh, please do! I
know I should be found fully competent, and promise you
that I would do my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there may be no harm in my writing to the lady
about you,&rdquo; decided Mrs. Moffit, won over by the girl&rsquo;s
gentle respect&mdash;with which she did not get treated by all
her clients. &ldquo;Suppose you come here again on Monday
next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The end of the matter was that Miss West was engaged
by the lady mentioned&mdash;no other than Mrs. Carradyne.
And she journeyed down into Worcestershire to enter upon
the situation.</p>

<p>But clever (and generally correct) Mrs. Moffit made one
mistake, arising, no doubt, from the chronic state of hurry
she was always in. &ldquo;Miss West is the daughter of the late
Colonel William West,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;who went to India with
his regiment a few years ago, and died there.&rdquo; What Miss
West had said to her was this: &ldquo;My father, a clergyman,
died when I was a little child, and my uncle William,
Colonel West, the only relation I had left, died three
years ago in India.&rdquo; Mrs. Moffit somehow confounded
the two.</p>

<p>This might not have mattered on the whole. But, as you
perceive, it conveyed a wrong impression at Leet Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The governess I have engaged is a Miss West; her
father was a military man and a gentleman,&rdquo; spake Mrs.
Carradyne one morning at breakfast to Captain Monk.
&ldquo;She is rather young&mdash;about twenty, I fancy; but an older
person might never get on at all with Kate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had good references with her, I suppose?&rdquo; said the
Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. From the agent, and especially from the ladies
who have brought her up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was her father, do you say?&mdash;a military man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel William West,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Carradyne,
referring to the letter she held. &ldquo;He went to India with
his regiment and died there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll refer to the army-list,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;daresay
it&rsquo;s all right. And she shall keep Kate in order, or I&rsquo;ll know
the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The evening sunlight lay on the green plain, on the white
fields from which the grain had been reaped, and on the
beautiful woods glowing with the varied tints of autumn. A
fly was making its way to Leet Hall, and its occupant, looking
out of it on this side and that, in a fever of ecstasy, for
the country scene charmed her, thought how favoured was
the lot of those who could live out their lives amidst its
surroundings.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room at the Hall, watching the approach
of this same fly, stood Mrs. Hamlyn, a frown upon her
haughty face. Philip Hamlyn was still detained in the West
Indies, and since her reconciliation to her father, she would
go over with her baby-boy to the Hall and remain there for
days together. Captain Monk liked to have her, and he
took more notice of the baby than he had ever taken of a baby
yet. For when Kate was an infant he had at first shunned
her, because she had cost Katherine her life. This baby,
little Walter, was a particularly forward child, strong and
upright, walked at ten months old, and much resembled his
mother in feature. In temper also. The young one would
stand sturdily in his little blue shoes and defy his grandpapa
already, and assert his own will, to the amused admiration of
Captain Monk.</p>

<p>Eliza, utterly wrapt up in her child, saw her father&rsquo;s growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
love for him with secret delight; and one day when he had
the boy on his knee, she ventured to speak out a thought
that was often in her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said, with impassioned fervour, &ldquo;<em>he</em> ought to
be the heir, your own grandson; not Harry Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk simply stared in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lies in the <em>direct</em> succession; he has your own blood
in his veins. Papa, you ought to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly the gallant sailor&rsquo;s manners were improving.
For perhaps the first time in his life he suppressed the hot
and abusive words rising to his tongue&mdash;that no son of that
man, Hamlyn, should come into Leet Hall&mdash;and stood in
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t</em> you see it, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Eliza: we&rsquo;ll drop the subject. When my
brother, your uncle, was dying, he wrote me a letter,
enjoining me to make Emma&rsquo;s son the heir, failing a son
of my own. It was right it should be so, he said. Right
it is; and Harry Carradyne will succeed me. Say no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus forbidden to say more, Eliza Hamlyn thought the
more, and her thoughts were not pleasant. At one time she
had feared her father might promote Kate Dancox to the
heirship, and grew to dislike the child accordingly. Latterly,
for the same reason, she had disliked Harry Carradyne;
hated him, in fact. She herself was the only remaining child
of the house, and her son ought to inherit.</p>

<p>She stood this evening at the drawing-room window, this
and other matters running in her mind. Miss Kate, at the
other end of the room, had prevailed on Uncle Harry (as
she called him) to play a game at toy ninepins. Or perhaps
he had prevailed on her: anything to keep her tolerably
quiet. She was in her teens now, but the older she grew
the more troublesome she became; and she was remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
small and childish-looking, so that strangers took her to be
several years younger than she really was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This must be your model governess arriving, Aunt
Emma,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Hamlyn, as the fly came up the
drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carradyne; and they all looked
out. &ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s an Evesham fly&mdash;and a ramshackle
thing it appears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder you did not send the carriage to Evesham for
her, mother,&rdquo; remarked Harry, picking up some of the nine-pins
which Miss Kate had swept off the table with her hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn turned round in a blaze of anger. &ldquo;Send
the carriage to Evesham for the governess. What absurd
thing will you say next, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man laughed in good humour. &ldquo;Does it
offend one of your prejudices, Eliza?&mdash;a thousand pardons,
then. But really, nonsense apart, I can&rsquo;t see why the carriage
should not have gone for her. We are told she is a
gentlewoman. Indeed, I suppose anyone else would not be
eligible, as she is to be made one of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And think of the nuisance it will be! Do be quiet,
Harry! Kate ought to have been sent to school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your father would not have her sent, you know,
Eliza,&rdquo; spoke Mrs. Carradyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss West, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; interrupted Rimmer, the butler,
showing in the traveller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, how very young!&rdquo; was Mrs. Carradyne&rsquo;s first
thought. &ldquo;And what a lovely face!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came in shyly. In her whole appearance there was a
shrinking, timid gentleness, betokening refinement of feeling.
A slender, lady-like girl, in a plain, dark travelling-suit and
a black bonnet lined and tied with pink, a little lace border
shading her nut-brown hair. The bonnets in those days set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
off a pretty face better than do these modern ones. That&rsquo;s
what the Squire tells us.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carradyne advanced and shook hands cordially;
Eliza bent her head slightly from where she stood; Harry
Carradyne stood up, a pleasant welcome in his blue eyes and
in his voice, as he laughingly congratulated her upon the
ancient Evesham fly not having come to grief en route. Kate
Dancox pressed forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you my new governess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young lady smiled and said she believed so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Eliza hates governesses; so do I. Do you expect
to make me obey you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The governess blushed painfully; but took courage to say
she hoped she should. Harry Carradyne thought it the very
loveliest blush he had ever seen in all his travels, and she the
sweetest-looking girl.</p>

<p>And when Captain Monk came in he quite took to her
appearance, for he hated to have ugly people about him.
But every now and then there was a look in her face, or in
her eyes, that struck him as being familiar&mdash;as if he had once
known someone who resembled her. Pleasing, soft, dark
hazel eyes they were as one could wish to see, with goodness
in their depths.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Months passed away, and Miss West was domesticated in
her new home. It was not all sunshine. Mrs. Carradyne,
ever considerate, strove to render things agreeable; but there
were sources of annoyance over which she had no control.
Kate, when she chose, could be verily a little elf, a demon;
as Mrs. Hamlyn often put it, &ldquo;a diablesse.&rdquo; And she, that
lady herself, invariably treated the governess with a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
cool, indifferent contempt; and she was more often at Leet
Hall than away from it. The Captain, too, gave way to fits
of temper that simply terrified Miss West. Reared in the
quiet atmosphere of a well-trained school, she had never met
with temper such as this.</p>

<p>On the other hand&mdash;yes, on the other hand, she had an
easy place of it, generous living, was regarded as a lady,
and&mdash;she had learnt to love Harry Carradyne for weal or
for woe.</p>

<p>But not&mdash;please take notice&mdash;not unsolicited. Tacitly, at
any rate. If Mr. Harry&rsquo;s speaking blue eyes were to be
trusted and Mr. Harry&rsquo;s tell-tale tones when with her, his
love, at the very least, equalled hers. Eliza Hamlyn, despite
the penetration that ill-nature generally can exercise, had
not yet scented any such treason in the wind: or there would
have blown up a storm.</p>

<p>Spring was to bring its events; but first of all it must be
said that during the winter little Walter Hamlyn was taken
ill at Leet Hall when staying there with his mother. The
malady turned out to be gastric fever, and Mr. Speck was in
constant attendance. For the few days that the child lay
in danger, Eliza was almost wild. The progress to convalescence
was very slow, lasting many weeks; and during that
time Captain Monk, being much with the little fellow, grew
to be fond of him with an unreasonable affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure but I shall leave Leet Hall to him after all,&rdquo;
he suddenly observed to Eliza one day, not noticing that
Harry Carradyne was standing in the recess of the window.
&ldquo;Halloa! are you there, Harry? Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped.
You heard what I said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard, Uncle Godfrey: but I did not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliza thinks Leet Hall ought to go in the direct line&mdash;through
her&mdash;to this child. What should you say to
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What could he say to it?&rdquo; imperiously demanded Eliza.
&ldquo;He is only your nephew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry looked from one to the other in a sort of bewildered
surprise: and there came a silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Godfrey,&rdquo; he said at last, starting out of a reverie,
&ldquo;you have been good enough to make me your heir. It was
unexpected on my part, unsolicited; but you did do it, and
you caused me to leave the army in consequence, to give up
my fair prospects in life. I am aware that this deed is not
irrevocable, and certainly you have the right to do what you
will with your own property. But you must forgive me for
saying that you should have made quite sure of your intentions
beforehand: before taking me up, if it be only to
throw me aside again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, we&rsquo;ll leave it,&rdquo; retorted Captain Monk
testily. &ldquo;No harm&rsquo;s done to you yet, Mr. Harry; I don&rsquo;t
know that it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Harry Carradyne felt sure that it would be; that he
should be despoiled of the inheritance. The resolute
look of power on Eliza&rsquo;s face, bent on him as he quitted
the chamber, was an earnest of that. Captain Monk
was not the determined man he had once been; that was
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty kettle of fish, this is,&rdquo; ruefully soliloquised
Harry, as he marched along the corridor. &ldquo;Eliza&rsquo;s safe to
get her will; no doubt of that. And I? what am I to do?
I can&rsquo;t repurchase and go back amongst them again like a
returned shilling; at least, I won&rsquo;t; and I can&rsquo;t turn Parson,
or Queen&rsquo;s Counsel, or Cabinet Minister. I&rsquo;m fitted for
nothing now, that I see, but to be a gentleman-at-large; and
what would the gentleman&rsquo;s income be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing at the corridor window, softly whistling, he ran
over ways and means in his mind. He had a pretty house
of his own, Peacock&rsquo;s Range, formerly his father&rsquo;s, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
four hundred a-year. After his mother&rsquo;s death it would not
be less than a thousand a-year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means bread and cheese at present. Later&mdash;&mdash;
Heyday, young lady, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The school room door, close by, had opened with a burst,
and Miss Kate Dancox was flying down the stairs&mdash;her usual
progress the minute lessons were over. Harry strolled into
the room. The governess was putting the littered table
straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any admission, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; cried he quaintly, making for
a chair. &ldquo;I should like to ask leave to sit down for a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice West laughed, and stirred the fire by way of
welcome; he was a very rare visitor to the school-room.
The blaze, mingling with the rays of the setting sun that
streamed in at the window, played upon her sweet face and
silky brown hair, lighted up the bright winter dress she wore,
and the bow of pink ribbon that fastened the white lace
round her slender, pretty throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so much in need of a seat?&rdquo; she laughingly
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; was the semi-grave response. &ldquo;I have
had a shock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very sharp one, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharp as steel. Really and truly,&rdquo; he went on in a
different tone, as he left the chair and stood up by the table,
facing her; &ldquo;I have just heard news that may affect my
whole future life; may change me from a rich man to a
poor one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Carradyne!&rdquo; Her manner had changed now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the destined inheritor, as you know&mdash;for I&rsquo;m sure
nobody has been reticent upon the subject&mdash;of these broad
lands,&rdquo; with a sweep of the hand towards the plains outside.
&ldquo;Captain Monk is now pleased to inform me that he thinks
of substituting for me Mrs. Hamlyn&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But would not that be very unjust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly fair&mdash;as it seems to me. Considering that my
good uncle obliged me to give up my own prospects
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood, her hands clasped in sympathy, her face full
of earnest sadness. &ldquo;How unkind! Why, it would be
cruel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I confess I felt it to be so at the first blow. But,
standing at the outside window yonder, pulling myself
together, a ray or two of light crept in, showing me that
it may be for the best after all. &lsquo;Whatever <em>is</em>, is right,&rsquo;
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she slowly said&mdash;&ldquo;if you can think so. But, Mr.
Carradyne, should you not have anything at all?&mdash;anything
to live upon after Captain Monk&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a trifle, I calculate, as the Americans say&mdash;and it is
calculating I have been&mdash;so that I need not altogether starve.
Would you like to know how much it will be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t laugh at me!&rdquo;&mdash;for it suddenly struck
the girl that he was laughing, perhaps in reproof, and that
she had spoken too freely. &ldquo;I ought not to have asked
that; I was not thinking&mdash;I was too sorry to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I may as well tell you, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I have
a very pretty little place, which you have seen and heard of,
called by that delectable title Peacock&rsquo;s Range&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Peacock&rsquo;s Range yours?&rdquo; she interrupted, in surprise.
&ldquo;I thought it belonged to Mr. Peveril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peacock&rsquo;s Range is mine and was my father&rsquo;s before
me, Miss Alice. It was leased to Peveril for a term of
years, but I fancy he would be glad to give it up to-morrow.
Well, I have Peacock&rsquo;s Range and about four hundred
pounds a-year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face brightened. &ldquo;Then you need not talk about
starving,&rdquo; she said, gaily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And, later, I shall have altogether about a thousand
a-year. Though I hope it will be very long before it falls
to me. Do you think two people might venture to set up at
Peacock&rsquo;s Range, and keep, say, a couple of servants upon
four hundred a-year? Could they exist upon it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, yes,&rdquo; she answered eagerly, quite unconscious
of his drift. &ldquo;Did you mean yourself and some
friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t see how they could spend it all. There&rsquo;d
be no rent to pay. And just think of all the fruit and
vegetables in the garden there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I take you at your word, Alice,&rdquo; he cried, impulsively,
passing his arm round her waist. &ldquo;You are the
&lsquo;friend.&rsquo; My dear, I have long wanted to ask you to be my
wife, and I did not dare. This place, Leet Hall, encumbered
me: for I feared the opposition that I, as its heir, should
inevitably meet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew away from him, with doubting, frightened eyes.
Mr. Harry Carradyne brought all the persuasion of his own
dancing blue ones to bear upon her. &ldquo;Surely, Alice, you
will not say me nay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare not say yes,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of it altogether; of your friends. Captain Monk would&mdash;would&mdash;perhaps&mdash;turn
me out. And there&rsquo;s Mrs. Carradyne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry laughed. &ldquo;Captain Monk can have no right to
any voice in my affairs, once he throws me off; he cannot
expect to have a finger in everyone&rsquo;s pie. As to my mother&mdash;ah,
Alice, unless I am much mistaken, she will welcome
you with love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice burst into tears: emotion was stirring her to its
depths. &ldquo;<em>Please</em> to let it all be for a time,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you speak it would be sure to lead to my being turned
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>will</em> let it be for a time, my darling, so far as speaking
about it goes: for more reasons than one it may be better.
But you are my promised wife, Alice; always recollect
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Harry Carradyne, bold as a soldier should be,
took a few kisses from her unresisting lips to enforce his
mandate.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Some time rolled on, calling for no particular record. Mr.
Hamlyn&rsquo;s West Indian property, which was large and
lucrative, had been giving him trouble of late; at least,
those who had the care of it gave it, and he was obliged to
go over occasionally to see after it in person. Between
times he stayed with his wife at Peacock&rsquo;s Range; or else
she joined him in London. Their town residence was in
Bryanston Square; a pretty house, but not large.</p>

<p>It had been an unfavourable autumn; cold and wet.
Snow had fallen in November, and the weather continued
persistently dull and dreary. One gloomy afternoon towards
the close of the year, Mrs. Hamlyn, shivering over her
drawing-room fire, rang impatiently for more coal to be
piled upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Master Walter come in yet?&rdquo; she asked of the
footman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am. I saw him just now playing in front
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went to the window. Yes, running about the paths
of the Square garden was the child, attended by his nurse.
He was a sturdy little fellow. His mother, wishing to make
him hardy, sent him out in all weathers, and the boy throve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
upon it. He was three years old now, but looked older;
and he was as clever and precocious as some children are at
five or six. Her heart thrilled with a strange joy only at
the sight of him: he was her chief happiness in life, her idol.
Whether he would succeed to Leet Hall she knew not; since
that one occasion, Captain Monk had said no more upon
the subject, for or against it.</p>

<p>Why need she have longed for it so fervently? to the
setting at naught the express wishes of her deceased uncle
and to the detriment of Harry Carradyne? It was simply
covetousness. As his father&rsquo;s eldest son (there were no
younger ones yet) the boy would inherit a fine property, a
large income; but his doting mother must give him Leet
Hall as well.</p>

<p>Her whole heart went out to the child as she watched
him playing there. A few snowflakes were beginning to fall,
and twilight would soon be drawing on, but she would not
call him in. Standing thus at the window, it gradually grew
upon her to notice that something was standing back against
the opposite rails, looking fixedly at the houses. A young,
fair woman apparently, with a profusion of light hair; she
was draped in a close dark cloak which served to conceal
her figure, just as the thick veil she wore concealed
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it is <em>this</em> house she is gazing at so attentively&mdash;and
at <em>me</em>,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Hamlyn. &ldquo;What can she
possibly want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman did not move away and Mrs. Hamlyn did
not move; they remained staring at one another. Presently
Walter burst into the room, laughing in glee at having
distanced his nurse. His mother turned, caught him in her
arms and kissed him passionately. Wilful though he was
by disposition, and showing it at times, he was a lovable,
generous child, and very pretty: great brown eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
auburn curls. His life was all sunshine, like a butterfly&rsquo;s on
a summer&rsquo;s day; his path as yet one of roses without their
thorns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, I&rsquo;ve got a picture-book; come and look at it,&rdquo;
cried the eager little voice, as he dragged his mother to the
hearthrug and opened the picture-book in the light of the
blaze. &ldquo;Penelope bought it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat down on a footstool, the book on her lap and
one arm round him, her treasure. Penelope waited to take
off his hat and pelisse, and was told to come for him in
five minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my tea-time yet,&rdquo; cried he defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, then, Master Walter, it is long past it,&rdquo; said the
nurse. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get him in before, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she added
to her mistress. &ldquo;Every minute I kept expecting you&rsquo;d be
sending one of the servants after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In five minutes,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Hamlyn. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s
<em>this</em> picture about, Walter? Is it a little girl with a doll?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dat bootiful,&rdquo; said the eager little lad, who was not
yet as advanced in speech as he was in ideas. &ldquo;It says
she&mdash;&mdash;dere&rsquo;s papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In came Philip Hamlyn, tall, handsome, genial. Walter
ran to him and was caught in his arms. He and his wife
were just a pair for adoring the child.</p>

<p>But nurse, inexorable, appeared again at the five minutes&rsquo;
end, and Master Walter was carried off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came home in a cab, Philip, did you not? I thought
I heard one stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is a miserable evening. Raining fast now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raining!&rdquo; she repeated, rather wondering to hear it
was not snowing. She went to the window to look out,
and the first object her eyes caught sight of was the woman;
leaning in the old place against the railings, in the growing
twilight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry to see the rain; we shall have it warmer
now,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Hamlyn, who had drawn a chair to the
fire. &ldquo;In fact, it&rsquo;s much warmer already than it was this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip, step here a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife&rsquo;s tone had dropped to a half-whisper, sounding
rather mysterious, and he went at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just look, Philip&mdash;opposite. Do you see a woman
standing there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman&mdash;where?&rdquo; cried he, looking of course in every
direction but the right one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just facing us. She has her back against the railings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ay, I see now; a lady in a cloak. She must be
waiting for some one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you call her a lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks like one&mdash;as far as I can see in the gloom.
Does she not? Her hair does, any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been there I cannot tell you how long, Philip;
half-an-hour, I&rsquo;m sure; and it seems to me that she is
<em>watching</em> this house. A lady would hardly do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This house? Oh, then, Eliza, perhaps she&rsquo;s watching
for one of the servants. She might come in, poor thing,
instead of standing there in the rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor thing, indeed!&mdash;what business has any woman to
watch a house in this marked manner?&rdquo; retorted Eliza.
&ldquo;The neighbourhood will be taking her for a female
detective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has given me a creepy feeling; I can tell you that,
Philip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you why; I don&rsquo;t know why; it is so. Do
not laugh at me for confessing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn did laugh; heartily. &ldquo;Creepy feelings&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and his imperiously strong-minded wife could have but
little affinity with one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the curtains drawn, and the lights, and shut
her out,&rdquo; said he cheerily. &ldquo;Come and sit down, Eliza; I
want to show you a letter I&rsquo;ve had to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the woman waiting outside there seemed to possess
for Eliza Hamlyn somewhat of the fascination of the basilisk;
for she never stirred from the window until the curtains
were drawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is from Peveril,&rdquo; said Mr. Hamlyn, producing the
letter he had spoken of from his pocket. &ldquo;The lease he
took of Peacock&rsquo;s Range is not yet out, but he can resign it
now if he pleases, and he would be glad to do so. He and
his wife would rather remain abroad, it seems, than return
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he writes to me to ask whether he can resign it;
or whether I must hold him to the promise he made me&mdash;that
I should rent the house to the end of the term. I mean
the end of the lease; the term he holds it for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does he want to resign it? Why can&rsquo;t things go
on as at present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gather from an allusion he makes, though he does not
explicitly state it, that Mr. Carradyne wishes to have the
place in his own hands. What am I to say to Peveril,
Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! Why, that you must hold him to his promise;
that we cannot give up the house yet. A pretty thing if
I had no place to go down to at will in my own county!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far as I am concerned, Eliza, I would prefer to stay
away from the county&mdash;if your father is to continue to treat
me in the way he does. Remember what it was in the
summer. I think we are very well here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Philip, I have <em>said</em>. I do not intend to release<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
our hold on Peacock&rsquo;s Range. My father will be reconciled
to you in time as he is to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Harry Carradyne can want it for?&rdquo;
mused Philip Hamlyn, bowing to the imperative decision of
his better half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To live in it, I should say. He would like to show his
resentment to papa by turning his back on Leet Hall. It
can&rsquo;t be for anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cause for resentment has he? He sent for him
home and made him his heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>That</em> is the cause. Papa has come to his senses and
changed his mind. It is our darling little Walter who is to
be the heir of Leet Hall, Philip&mdash;and papa has so informed
Harry Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn gazed at his wife in doubt. He had never
heard a word of this; instinct had kept her silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he emphatically said, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You hope not?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter shall never inherit Leet Hall with my consent,
Eliza. Harry Carradyne is the right and proper heir, and
no child of mine, as I hope, must or shall displace him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn treated her husband to one of her worst
looks, telling of contempt as well as of power; but she did
not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Eliza. I cannot bear injustice, and I do not
believe it ever prospers in the long run. Were your father
to bequeath&mdash;my dear, I beg of you to listen to me!&mdash;to
bequeath his estates to little Walter, to the exclusion of the
true heir, rely upon it the bequest would <em>never bring him
good</em>. In some way or other it would not serve him.
Money diverted by injustice from its natural and just
channel does not carry a blessing with it. I have noted
this over and over again in going through life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; she contemptuously asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And Walter will not need it,&rdquo; he continued persuasively,
passing her question as unheard. &ldquo;As my son, he will be
amply provided for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very commonplace interruption occurred, and the subject
was dropped. Nothing more than a servant bringing
in a letter for his master, just come by hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is from old Richard Pratt!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Hamlyn, as he turned to the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought Major Pratt never wrote letters,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;I once heard you say he must have forgotten
how to write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer. He was reading the note, which
appeared to be a short one. She watched him. After reading
it through he began it again, a puzzled look upon his
face. Then she saw it flush all over, and he crushed the
note into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it about, Philip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pratt wants a prescription for gout that I told him of.
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know whether I can find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had answered in a dreamy tone with thoughts preoccupied,
and quitted the room hastily, as if in search of it.</p>

<p>Eliza wondered why he should flush up at being asked for
a prescription, and why he should have suddenly lost himself
in a reverie. But she had not much curiosity as to anything
that concerned old Major Pratt&mdash;who was at present
staying in lodgings in London.</p>

<p>Downstairs went Mr. Hamlyn to the little room he called
his library, seated himself at the table under the lamp, and
opened the note again. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Philip Hamlyn</span>,&mdash;The other day, when calling
here, you spoke of some infallible prescription to cure gout
that had been given you. I&rsquo;ve symptoms of it flying about
me&mdash;and be hanged to it! Bring it to me yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
to-morrow; I want to see you. <em>I suppose there was no mistake
in the report that that ship did go down?</em>&mdash;and that none of
the passengers were saved from it?</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign4">&ldquo;Truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Richard Pratt.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What can he possibly mean?&rdquo; muttered Philip Hamlyn.</p>

<p>But there was no one to answer the question, and he sat
buried in thought, trying to answer it himself. Starting up
from the useless task, he looked in his desk, found the
infallible prescription, and then snatched his watch from
his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; he decided impatiently; &ldquo;Pratt would be
gone to bed. He goes at all kinds of unearthly hours when
out of sorts.&rdquo; So he went upstairs to his wife again, the
prescription displayed in his hand.</p>

<p>Morning came, bringing the daily routine of duties in its
train. Mrs. Hamlyn had made an engagement to go with
some friends to Blackheath, to take luncheon with a lady
living there. It was damp and raw in the early portion of
the day, but promised to be clear later on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then my little darling can go out to play again,&rdquo;
she said, hugging the child to her. &ldquo;In the afternoon,
nurse; it will be drier then; it is really too damp this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parting from him with fifty kisses, she went down to her
comfortable and handsome carriage, her husband placing
her in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you were coming with me, Philip! But, you see,
it is only ladies to-day. Six of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish it at all,&rdquo; he
answered; &ldquo;they would be fighting for me. Besides, I must
take old Pratt his prescription. Only picture his storm of
anger if I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn was not back until just before dinner: her
husband, she heard, had been out all day, and was not yet
in. Waiting for him in the drawing-room listlessly enough,
she walked to the window to look out. And there she saw
with a sort of shock the same woman standing in the same
place as the previous evening. Not once all day long had
she thought of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a strange thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I am <em>sure</em>
it is this house that she is watching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the impulse of the moment she rang the bell and
called the man who answered it to the window. He was a
faithful, attached servant, had lived with them ever since
they were married, and previously to that in Mr. Hamlyn&rsquo;s
family in the West Indies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Japhet,&rdquo; said his mistress, &ldquo;do you see that woman
opposite? Do you know why she stands there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Japhet&rsquo;s answer told nothing. They had all seen her
downstairs, yesterday evening as well as this, and wondered
what she could be watching the house for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not waiting for any of the servants, then; not an
acquaintance of theirs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, that I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s not. She is a stranger
to us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Japhet, I think you shall go over and question
her,&rdquo; spoke his mistress impulsively. &ldquo;Ask her who she is
and what she wants. And tell her that a gentleman&rsquo;s house
cannot be watched with impunity in this country&mdash;and she
will do well to move away before the police are called to
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Japhet looked at his mistress and hesitated; he was an
elderly man and cautious. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madam,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;for venturing to say as much, but I think it
might be best to let her alone. She&rsquo;ll grow tired of stopping
there. And if her motive is to attract pity, and get alms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
sent out, why the fact of speaking to her might make her
bold enough to ask for them. If she comes there to-morrow
again, it might be best for the master to take it up himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For once in her life Mrs. Hamlyn condescended to listen
to the opinion of an inferior, and Japhet was dismissed without
orders. Close upon that, a cab came rattling down the
square, and stopped at the door. Her husband leaped out
of it, tossed the driver his fare&mdash;he always paid liberally&mdash;and
let himself in with his latch-key. To Mrs. Hamlyn&rsquo;s
astonishment she had seen the woman dart from her standing-place
to the middle of the road, evidently to look at or
to accost Mr. Hamlyn. But his movements were too quick:
he was within in a moment and had closed the outer door.
She then walked rapidly away, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Eliza Hamlyn stood there lost in thought. The nurse
came in to take the child; Mr. Hamlyn had gone to his
room to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the woman who has been standing out
there yesterday evening and this, Penelope?&rdquo; she asked of
the nurse, speaking upon impulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ma&rsquo;am. She has been there all the blessed
afternoon. She came into the garden to talk to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Came into the garden to talk to you?&rdquo; repeated Mrs.
Hamlyn. &ldquo;What did she talk about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chiefly about Master Walter, ma&rsquo;am. She seemed to
be much taken with him; clasped him in her arms and
kissed him, and said how old was he, and was he difficult
to manage, and that he had his father&rsquo;s beautiful brown
eyes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Penelope stopped abruptly. Mistaking the hard stare
her mistress was unconsciously giving her for one of displeasure,
she hastened to excuse herself. The fact was,
Mrs. Hamlyn&rsquo;s imagination was beginning to run riot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help her speaking to me, ma&rsquo;am, or her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
kissing the child; she took me by surprise. That was all
she said&mdash;except that she asked whether you were likely to
be going into the country soon, away from the house here.
She didn&rsquo;t stay five minutes with us, but went back to stand
by the railings again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she speak as a lady or as a common person?&rdquo;
quite fiercely demanded Mrs. Hamlyn. &ldquo;Is she young?&mdash;good-looking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think she is a lady,&rdquo; replied the girl, her accent
decisive. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s young, as far as I could see, but she
had a thick veil over her face. Her hair is lovely, just like
threads of pale gold,&rdquo; concluded Penelope, as Mr. Hamlyn&rsquo;s
step was heard.</p>

<p>He took his wife into the dining-room, apologising for
being late. She, giving full range to the fancies she had
called up, heard him in silence with a hardening haughty
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip, you know who that woman is,&rdquo; she suddenly
exclaimed during a temporary absence of Japhet from the
dining-room. &ldquo;What is it that she wants with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; he returned, in a surprise very well feigned if not
real. &ldquo;What woman? Do you mean the one who was
standing out there yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I do. She has been there again&mdash;all the
blessed afternoon, as Penelope expresses it. Asking questions
of the girl about you&mdash;and me&mdash;and Walter; and
saying the child has your beautiful brown eyes. <em>I ask you
who is she?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn laid down his knife and fork to gaze at his
wife. He looked quite at sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliza, I assure you I know nothing about it. Or about
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Don&rsquo;t you think it may be some acquaintance,
old or new? Possibly someone you knew in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
gone by&mdash;come over seas to see whether you are yet in the
land of the living? She has wonderful hair, which looks
like spun gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All in a moment, as the half-mocking words left her lips,
some idea seemed to flash across Philip Hamlyn, bringing
with it distress and fear. His face turned to a burning red
and then grew white as the hue of the grave.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE SILENT CHIMES</h2>


<h3>V.&mdash;SILENT FOR EVER</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Breakfast was on the table in Mr. Hamlyn&rsquo;s house in
Bryanston Square, and Mrs. Hamlyn waited, all impatience,
for her lord and master. Not in any particular impatience
for the meal itself, but that she might &ldquo;have it out with
him&rdquo;&mdash;the phrase was hers, not mine, as you will see
presently&mdash;in regard to the perplexity existing in her mind
connected with the strange appearance of the damsel watching
the house, in her beauty and her pale golden hair.</p>

<p>Why had Philip Hamlyn turned sick and faint&mdash;to judge
by his changing countenance&mdash;when she had charged him
at dinner, the previous evening, with knowing something of
this mysterious woman? Mysterious in her actions, at all
events; probably in herself. Mrs. Hamlyn wanted to know
that. No further opportunity had then been given for
pursuing the subject. Japhet had returned to the room, and
before the dinner was at an end, some acquaintance of Mr.
Hamlyn had fetched him out for the evening. And he
came home with so fearful a headache that he had lain
groaning and turning all through the night. Mrs. Hamlyn
was not a model of patience, but in all her life she had
never felt so impatient as now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>He came into the room looking pale and shivery; a sure
sign that he was suffering; that it was not an invented excuse.
Yes, the pain was better, he said, in answer to his wife&rsquo;s
question; and might be much better after a strong cup of
tea; he could not imagine what had brought it on. <em>She</em>
could have told him, though, had she been gifted with the
magical power of reading minds, and have seen the nervous
apprehension that was making havoc with his.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn gave him his tea in silence, and buttered a
dainty bit of toast to tempt him to eat. But he shook his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot, Eliza. Nothing but tea this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you are ill,&rdquo; she said, by-and-by. &ldquo;I fear it
hurts you to talk; but I want to have it out with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it out with me!&rdquo; cried he, in real or feigned
surprise. &ldquo;Have what out with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know, Philip. About that woman who has
been watching the house these two days; evidently watching
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I told you I knew nothing about her: who she is,
or what she is, or what she wants. I really do not
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, so far that was true. But all the while a sick fear
lay on his heart that he did know; or, rather, that he was
destined to know very shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I told you her hair was like threads of fine, pale
gold, you seemed to start, Philip, as if you knew some girl
or woman with such hair, or had known her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay I have known a score of women with such
hair. My dear little sister who died, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not attempt to evade the subject,&rdquo; was the haughty
reprimand. &ldquo;If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn&rsquo;s sharp speech was interrupted by the
entrance of Japhet, bringing in the morning letters. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
one letter, however, for they were not as numerous in those
days as they are in these.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to be important, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Japhet remarked,
with the privilege of an old servant, as he handed it to his
mistress. She saw it was from Leet Hall, in Mrs. Carradyne&rsquo;s
handwriting, and bore the words: &ldquo;In haste,&rdquo; above
the address.</p>

<p>Tearing it open Eliza Hamlyn read the short, sad news
it contained. Captain Monk had been taken suddenly ill
with inward inflammation. Mr. Speck feared the worst, and
the Captain had asked for Eliza. Would she come down at
once?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Philip, I must not lose a minute,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
passing the letter to him, and forgetting the pale gold hair
and its owner. &ldquo;Do you know anything about the
Worcestershire trains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The better plan will be to get to
the station as soon as possible, and then you will be ready
for the first train that starts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go down with me, Philip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot. I will take you to the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot just now leave London. My dear,
you may believe me, for it is the truth. <em>I cannot do so.</em> I
wish I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she saw it was true: for his tone was so earnest as
to tell of pain.</p>

<p>Making what haste she could, kissing her boy a hundred
times, and recommending him to the special care of his
nurse and of his father during her absence, she drove with
her husband to the station, and was just in time for a train.
Mr. Hamlyn watched it steam out of the station, and then
looked up at the clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s not too early to see him,&rdquo; he muttered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it, at any rate. Hope he will be less suffering
than he was yesterday, and less crusty, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dismissing his carriage, for he felt more inclined to walk
than to drive, he went through the park to Pimlico, and
gained the house of Major Pratt.</p>

<p>This was Friday. On the previous Wednesday evening a
note had been brought to Mr. Hamlyn by Major Pratt&rsquo;s
servant, a sentence in which, as the reader may remember,
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>I suppose there was no mistake in the report that that
ship did go down?&mdash;and that none of the passengers were saved
from it?</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This puzzled Philip Hamlyn: perhaps somewhat troubled
him in a hazy kind of way. For he could only suppose
that the ship alluded to must be the sailing-vessel in which
his first wife, false and faithless, and his little son of a
twelvemonth old had been lost some five or six years ago&mdash;the
<cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>. And the next day (Thursday) he
had gone to Major Pratt&rsquo;s, as requested, to carry the prescription
for gout he had asked for, and also to inquire of
the Major what he meant.</p>

<p>But the visit was a fruitless one. Major Pratt was in bed
with an attack of gout, so ill and so &ldquo;crusty&rdquo; that nothing
could be got out of him excepting a few bad words and as
many groans. Mr. Hamlyn then questioned Saul&mdash;of whom
he used to see a good deal in India, for he had been the
Major&rsquo;s servant for years and years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know, Saul, whether the Major
wanted me for anything in particular? He asked me to
call here this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saul began to consider. He was a tall, thin, cautious,
slow-speaking man, honest as the day, and very much
attached to his master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, he got a letter yesterday morning that seemed
to put him out, for I found him swearing over it. And he
said he&rsquo;d like you to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the letter from? What was it about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looked like Miss Caroline&rsquo;s writing, sir, and the postmark
was Essex. As to what it was about&mdash;well, the Major
didn&rsquo;t directly tell me, but I gathered that it might be
about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; questioned Mr. Hamlyn, for the man
had come to a dead standstill. &ldquo;Speak out, Saul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said Saul, slowly rubbing the top of his head,
and the few grey hairs left on it, &ldquo;I thought&mdash;as you tell me
to speak&mdash;it must be something concerning that ship you
know of; she that went down on her voyage home, Mr.
Philip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, sir; the <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>. I thought it by
this,&rdquo; added Saul: &ldquo;that pretty nigh all day afterwards he
talked of nothing but that ship, asking me if I should
suppose it possible that the ship had not gone down and
every soul on board, leastways of her passengers, with her.
&lsquo;Master,&rsquo; said I, in answer, &lsquo;had that ship not gone down
and all her passengers with her, rely upon it, they&rsquo;d have
turned up long before this.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; stormed he, &lsquo;and
Caroline&rsquo;s a fool.&rsquo;&mdash;Which of course meant his sister, you
know, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn could not make much of this. So many
years had elapsed now since news came out to the world
that the unfortunate ship, <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>, went down off
the coast of Spain on her homeward voyage, and all her
passengers with her, as to be a fact of the past. Never a
doubt had been cast upon any part of the tidings, so far as
he knew.</p>

<p>With an uneasy feeling at his heart, he went off to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
city, to call upon the brokers, or agents, of the ship:
remembering quite well who they were, and that they lived
in Fenchurch Street. An elderly man, clerk in the house
for many years, and now a partner, received him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>?&rdquo; repeated the old gentleman,
after listening to what Mr. Hamlyn had to say. &ldquo;No, sir,
we don&rsquo;t know that any of her passengers were saved;
always supposed they were not. But lately we have had
some little cause to doubt whether one or two might not
have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn&rsquo;s heart beat faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me why you think this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that we think it; at best &rsquo;tis but a doubt,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;One of our own ships, getting in last month
from Madras, had a sailor on board who chanced to remark
to me, when he was up here getting his pay, that it was not
the first time he had served in our employ: he had been in
that ship that was lost, the <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>. And he
went on to say, in answer to a remark of mine about all the
passengers having been lost, that that was not quite correct,
for that one of them had certainly been saved&mdash;a lady or a
nurse, he didn&rsquo;t know which, and also a little child that she
was in charge of. He was positive about it, he added,
upon my expressing my doubts, for they got to shore in the
same small boat that he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true, think you?&rdquo; gasped Mr. Hamlyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, we are inclined to think it is not true,&rdquo; emphatically
spoke the old gentleman. &ldquo;Upon inquiring about this
man&rsquo;s character, we found that he is given to drinking, so
that what he says cannot always be relied upon. Again, it
seems next to an impossibility that if any passenger were
saved we should not have heard of it. Altogether we feel
inclined to judge that the man, though evidently believing
he spoke truth, was but labouring under an hallucination.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where I can find the man?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Hamlyn, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anywhere at present, sir. He has sailed again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that ended it for the day. Philip Hamlyn went home
and sat down to dinner with his wife, as already spoken of.
And when she told him that the mysterious lady waiting
outside must be waiting for him&mdash;probably some acquaintance
of his of the years gone by&mdash;it set his brain working
and his pulses throbbing, for he suddenly connected her
with what he had that day heard. No wonder his head
ached!</p>

<p>To-day, after seeing his wife off by train, he went to
find Major Pratt. The Major was better, and could talk,
swearing a great deal over the gout, and the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was from Caroline,&rdquo; he said, alluding to his sister,
Miss Pratt, who had been with him in India. &ldquo;She lives in
Essex, you know, Philip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know,&rdquo; answered Philip Hamlyn. &ldquo;But
what is it that Caroline says in her letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; said the Major, producing his sister&rsquo;s
letter and opening it. &ldquo;Listen. Here it is. &lsquo;The strangest
thing has happened, brother! Susan went to London
yesterday to get my fronts recurled at the hairdresser&rsquo;s, and
she was waiting in the shop, when a lady came out of the
back room, having been in there to get a little boy&rsquo;s hair
cut. Susan was quite struck dumb when she saw her: <em>she
thinks it was poor erring Dolly</em>; never saw such a likeness
before, she says; could almost swear to her by the lovely
pale gold hair. The lady pulled her veil over her face
when she saw Susan staring at her, and went away with
great speed. Susan asked the hairdresser&rsquo;s people if they
knew the lady&rsquo;s name, or who she was, but they told her
she was a stranger to them; had never been in the shop
before. Dear Richard, this is troubling me; I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
sleep all last night for thinking of it. Do you suppose it is
possible that Dolly and the boy were not drowned? Your
affectionate sister, Caroline.&rsquo; Now, did you ever read such
a letter?&rdquo; stormed the Major. &ldquo;If that Susan went home
and said she&rsquo;d seen St. Paul&rsquo;s blown up, Caroline would
believe it. Who&rsquo;s Susan, d&rsquo;ye say? Why, you&rsquo;ve lost your
memory, Philip. Susan was the English maid we had with
us in Calcutta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot possibly be true,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hamlyn with
quivering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, no! of course it can&rsquo;t be, hang it! Or else what
would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That might be logical though not satisfactory reasoning.
And Mr. Hamlyn thought of the woman said to be watching
for him, and her pale gold hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a cunning jade, if ever there was one, mark
you, Philip Hamlyn; that false wife of yours and kin of
mine; came of a cunning family on the mother&rsquo;s side.
Put it that she <em>was</em> saved: if it suited her to let us suppose
she was drowned, why, she&rsquo;d do it. <em>I</em> know Dolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And poor Philip Hamlyn, assenting to the truth of this
with all his heart, went out to face the battle that might be
coming upon him, lacking the courage for it.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The cold, clear afternoon air touching their healthy faces,
and Jack Frost nipping their noses, raced Miss West and
Kate Dancox up and down the hawthorn walk. It had
pleased that arbitrary young damsel, who was still very
childish, to enter a protest against going beyond the grounds
that fine winter&rsquo;s day; she would be in the hawthorn walk,
or nowhere; and she would run races there. As Miss
West gave in to her whims for peace&rsquo; sake in things not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
important, and as she was young enough herself not to
dislike running, to the hawthorn walk they went.</p>

<p>Captain Monk was recovering rapidly. His sudden
illness had been caused by drinking some cold cider when
some out-door exercise had made him dangerously hot.
The alarm and apprehension had now subsided; and Mrs.
Hamlyn, arriving three days ago in answer to the hasty
summons, was thinking of returning to London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are cheating!&rdquo; called out Kate, flying off at a
tangent to cross her governess&rsquo;s path. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to
get before me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently,&rdquo; corrected Miss West. &ldquo;My dear, we have run
enough for to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t, you ugly, cross old thing! Aunt Eliza says
you <em>are</em> ugly. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young lady&rsquo;s amenities were cut short by finding
herself suddenly lifted off her feet by Mr. Harry Carradyne,
who had come behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me alone, Harry! You are always coming where
you are not wanted. Aunt Eliza says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden light, as of mirth, illumined Harry Carradyne&rsquo;s
fresh, frank countenance. &ldquo;Aunt Eliza says all those things,
does she? Well, Miss Kate, she also says something else&mdash;that
you are now to go indoors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for? I shan&rsquo;t go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. Then that dandified silk frock for the
new year that the dressmaker is waiting to try on can be put
aside until midsummer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate dearly loved new silk frocks, and she raced away.
The governess followed more slowly, Mr. Carradyne talking
by her side.</p>

<p>For some months now their love-dream had been going
on; aye, and the love-making too. Not altogether surreptitiously;
neither of them would have liked that. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
not expedient to proclaim it yet to Captain Monk and the
world, Mrs. Carradyne knew of it and tacitly sanctioned it.</p>

<p>Alice West turned her face, blushing uncomfortably, to
him as they walked. &ldquo;I am glad to have this opportunity
of saying something to you,&rdquo; she spoke with hesitation.
&ldquo;Are you not upon rather bad terms with Mrs. Hamlyn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is with me,&rdquo; replied Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;am <em>I</em> the cause?&rdquo; continued Alice, feeling as if
her fears were confirmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. She has not fathomed the truth yet, with all
her penetration, though she may have some suspicion of it.
Eliza wants to bend me to her will in the matter of the
house, and I won&rsquo;t be bent. Old Peveril wishes to resign
the lease of Peacock Range to me; I wish to take it from
him, and Eliza objects. She says Peveril promised her the
house until the seven years&rsquo; lease was out, and that she
means to keep him to his bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarrel! no,&rdquo; laughed Harry Carradyne. &ldquo;I joke with
her, rather than quarrel. But I don&rsquo;t give in. She pays
me some left-handed compliments, telling me that I am no
gentleman, that I&rsquo;m a bear, and so on; to which I make my
bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice West was gazing straight before her, a troubled
look in her eyes. &ldquo;Then you see that I <em>am</em> the remote
cause of the quarrel, Harry. But for thinking of me, you
would not care to take the house on your own hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. Be very sure of one thing, Alice:
that I shall not stay an hour longer under the roof here if
my uncle disinherits me. That he, a man of indomitable
will, should be so long making up his mind is a proof that
he shrinks from committing the injustice. The suspense it
keeps me in is the worst of all. I told him so the other
evening when we were sitting together and he was in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
amiable mood. I said that any decision he might come to
would be more tolerable than this prolonged suspense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice drew a long breath at his temerity.</p>

<p>Harry laughed. &ldquo;Indeed, I quite expected to be ordered
out of the room in a storm. Instead of that, he took it
quietly, civilly telling me to have a little more patience;
and then began to speak of the annual new year&rsquo;s dinner,
which is not far off now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carradyne is thinking that he may not hold the
dinner this year, as he has been so ill,&rdquo; remarked the young
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will never give that up, Alice, as long as he can
hold anything; and he is almost well again, you know. Oh,
yes; we shall have the dinner and the chimes also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard the chimes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They have
not played since I came to Church Leet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are to play this year,&rdquo; said Harry Carradyne.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think my mother knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true that Mrs. Carradyne does not like to hear the
chimes? I seem to have gathered the idea, somehow,&rdquo;
added Alice. But she received no answer.</p>

<p>Kate Dancox was changeable as the ever-shifting sea.
Delighted with the frock that was in process, she extended
her approbation to its maker; and when Mrs. Ram, a
homely workwoman, departed with her small bundle in her
arms, it pleased the young lady to say she would attend her
to her home. This involved the attendance of Miss West,
who now found herself summoned to the charge.</p>

<p>Having escorted Mrs. Ram to her lowly door, and had
innumerable intricate questions answered touching trimmings
and fringes, Miss Kate Dancox, disregarding her
governess altogether, flew back along the road with all the
speed of her active limbs, and disappeared within the
churchyard. At first Alice, who was growing tired and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
followed slowly, could not see her; presently, a desperate
shriek guided her to an unfrequented corner where the
graves were crowded. Miss Kate had come to grief in
jumping over a tombstone, and bruised both her knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Alice, sitting down on the stump of
an old tree, close to the low wall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt yourself
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; returned Kate, who did not make
much of smarts. And she went limping away to Mr.
Grame, then doing some light work in his garden.</p>

<p>Alice sat on where she was, reading the inscriptions on the
tombstones; some of them so faint with time as to be hardly
discernible. While standing up to make out one that seemed
of a rather better class than the rest, she observed Nancy
Cale, the clerk&rsquo;s wife, sitting in the church-porch and watching
her attentively. The poor old woman had been ill for a
long time, and Alice was surprised to see her out. Leaving
the inscriptions, she went across the churchyard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, my dear young lady, I be up again, and thankful
enough to say it; and I thought as the day&rsquo;s so fine, I&rsquo;d step
out a bit,&rdquo; she said, in answer to the salutation. An intelligent
woman, and quite sufficiently cultivated for her work&mdash;cleaning
the church and washing the parson&rsquo;s surplices.
&ldquo;I thought John was in the church here, and came to speak
to him; but he&rsquo;s not, I find; the door&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw John down by Mrs. Ram&rsquo;s just now; he was talking
to Nott, the carpenter,&rdquo; observed Alice. &ldquo;Nancy, I was
trying to make out some of those old names; but it is
difficult to do so,&rdquo; she added, pointing to the crowded
corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, I see, my dear,&rdquo; nodded Nancy. &ldquo;<em>His</em> be worn
a&rsquo;most right off. I think I&rsquo;d have it done again, an I was
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have what done again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The name upon your poor papa&rsquo;s gravestone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>what</em>?&rdquo; exclaimed Alice. And Nancy repeated
her words.</p>

<p>Alice stared at her. Had Mrs. Cale&rsquo;s wits vanished in
her illness? &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying, Nancy?&rdquo;
she cried; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. What had papa to do with this place?
I think you must be wandering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy stared in her turn. &ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s not possible,&rdquo; she
said slowly, beginning to put two and two together, &ldquo;that
you don&rsquo;t know who you are, Miss West? That your papa
died here? and lies buried here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice West turned white, and sat down on the opposite
bench to Nancy. She did know that her father had died at
some small country living he held; but she never suspected
that it was at Church Leet. Her mother had gone to
London after his death, and set up a school&mdash;which succeeded
well. But soon she died, and the ladies who took to
the school before her death took to Alice with it. The child
was still too young to be told by her mother of the serious
past&mdash;or Mrs. West deemed her to be so. And she had
grown up in ignorance of her father&rsquo;s fate and of where he
died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we heard, me and John, that it was a Miss West
who had come to the Hall to be governess to Parson
Dancox&rsquo;s child, the name struck us both,&rdquo; went on Nancy.
&ldquo;Next we looked at your face, my dear, to trace any likeness
there might be, and we thought we saw it&mdash;for you&rsquo;ve
got your papa&rsquo;s eyes for certain. Then, one day when I
was dusting in here, I let fall a hymn-book from the Hall
pew; in picking it up it came open, and the name writ in it
stared me in the face, &lsquo;<em>Alice</em> West.&rsquo; After that, we had no
manner of doubt, him and me, and I&rsquo;ve often wished to talk
with you and tell you so. My dear, I&rsquo;ve had you on my
knee many a time when you were a little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice burst into tears of agitation. &ldquo;I never knew it! I
never knew it. Dear Nancy, what did papa die of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was a sad piece of business&mdash;he was killed,&rdquo;
said Nancy. And forthwith, rightly or wrongly, she,
garrulous with old age, told all the history.</p>

<p>It was an exciting interview, lasting until the shades of
evening surprised them. Miss Kate Dancox might have
gone roving to the other end of the globe, for all the
attention given her just then. Poor Alice cried and sighed,
and trembled inwardly and outwardly. &ldquo;To think that it
should just be to this place that I should come as governess,
and to the house of Captain Monk!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;Surely
he did not <em>kill</em> papa!&mdash;intentionally!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; nobody has ever thought that,&rdquo; disclaimed
Nancy. &ldquo;The Captain is a passionate man, as is well-known,
and they quarrelled, and a hot blow, not intentional,
must have been struck between &rsquo;em. And all through them
blessed chimes, Miss Alice! Not but that they be sweet to
listen to&mdash;and they be going to ring again this New Year&rsquo;s
Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing her warm cloak about her, Nancy Cale set off
towards her cottage. Alice West sat on in the sheltered
porch, utterly bewildered. Never in her life had she felt so
agitated, so incapable of sound and sober thought. <em>Now</em> it
was explained why the bow-windowed sitting-room at the
Vicarage would always strike her as being familiar to
her memory; as though she had at some time known
one that resembled it, or perhaps seen one like it in a
dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The jesting salutation came from Harry Carradyne.
Despatched in search of the truants, he had found Kate at
the Vicarage, making much of the last new baby there, and
devouring a sumptuous tea of cakes and jam. Miss West?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Oh, Miss West was sitting in the church porch, talking to old
Nancy Cale, she said to Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! What is it?&rdquo; he exclaimed in dismay, finding
that the burst of emotion which he had taken to be laughter,
meant tears. &ldquo;What has happened, Alice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could no more have kept the tears in than she could
help&mdash;presently&mdash;telling him the news. He sat down by
her and held her close to him, and pressed for it. She was
the daughter of George West, who had died in the dispute
with Captain Monk in the dining-room at the hall so many
years before, and who was lying here in the corner of the
churchyard; and she had never, never known it!</p>

<p>Mr. Carradyne was somewhat taken to; there was no
denying it; chiefly by surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought your father was a soldier, Alice&mdash;Colonel
West; and died when serving in India. I&rsquo;m sure it was
said so when you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, that could not have been said,&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;unless Mrs. Moffit, the agent, made a mistake. It was
my uncle who died in India. No one here ever questioned
me about my parents, knowing they were dead. Oh, dear,&rdquo;
she went on in agitation, after a silent pause, &ldquo;what am I to
do now? I cannot stay at the Hall. Captain Monk would
not allow it either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to tell him,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;of course&mdash;we must part. You and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Who says so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that it would be right to&mdash;to&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what? Go on, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice sighed; her eyes were fixed thoughtfully on the
fast-falling twilight. &ldquo;Mrs. Carradyne will not care for me
when she knows who I am,&rdquo; she said in low tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, shall I tell you how it strikes me?&rdquo; returned
Harry: &ldquo;that my mother will be only the more anxious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
have you connected with us by closer and dearer ties, so as
to atone to you, in even a small degree, for the cruel wrong
which fell upon your father. As to me&mdash;it shall be made
my life&rsquo;s best and dearest privilege.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when a climax such as this takes place, the right or
the wrong thing to be done cannot be settled in a moment.
Alice West did not see her way quite clearly, and for the
present she neither said nor did anything.</p>

<p>This little matter occurred on the Friday in Christmas
week; on the following day, Saturday, Mrs. Hamlyn was
returning to London. Christmas Day this year had fallen
on a Monday. Some old wives hold a superstition that
when that happens, it inaugurates but small luck for the
following year, either for communities or for individuals.
Not that that fancy has anything to do with the present
history. Captain Monk&rsquo;s banquet would not be held until
the Monday night: as was customary when New Year&rsquo;s Eve
fell on a Sunday. He had urged his daughter to remain
over New Year&rsquo;s Day; but she declined, on the plea that as
she had been away from her husband on Christmas Day, she
would like to pass New Year&rsquo;s Day with him. The truth
being that she wanted to get to London to see after that
yellow-haired lady who was supposed to be peeping after
Philip Hamlyn.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning Mrs. Hamlyn was driven to
Evesham in the close carriage, and took the train to
London. Her husband, ever kind and attentive, met her
at the Paddington terminus. He was looking haggard, and
seemed to be thinner than when she left him nine days ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well, Philip?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite well,&rdquo; quickly answered poor Philip Hamlyn,
smiling a warm smile, that he meant to look like a gay one.
&ldquo;Nothing ever ails me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, nothing might ail him bodily; but mentally&mdash;ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
how much! That awful terror lay upon him thick and
threefold; it had not yet come to any solution, one way or
the other. Major Pratt had taken up the very worst view
of it; and spent his days pitching hard names at misbehaving
syrens, gifted with &ldquo;the deuce&rsquo;s own cunning&rdquo; and with
mermaids&rsquo; shining hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how have things been going, Penelope?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Hamlyn of the nurse, as she sat in the nursery with
her boy upon her knee. &ldquo;All right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so, ma&rsquo;am. Master Walter has been just as good
as gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s darling!&rdquo; murmured the doting mother,
burying her face in his. &ldquo;I have been thinking, Penelope,
that your master does not look well,&rdquo; she added after a
minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am? I&rsquo;ve not noticed it. We have not seen
much of him up here; he has been at his club a good deal&mdash;and
dined three or four times with old Major Pratt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if she would notice it!&mdash;servants never notice anything!&rdquo;
thought Eliza Hamlyn in her imperious way of
judging the world. &ldquo;By the way, Penelope,&rdquo; she said aloud
in light and careless tones, &ldquo;has that woman with the yellow
hair been seen about much?&mdash;has she presumed again to
accost my little son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman with the yellow hair?&rdquo; repeated Penelope,
looking at her mistress, for the girl had quite forgotten the
episode. &ldquo;Oh, I remember&mdash;she that stood outside there
and came to us in the square-garden. No, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve
seen nothing at all of her since that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For there are wicked people who prowl about to kidnap
children,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Hamlyn, as if she would condescend
to explain her inquiry, &ldquo;and that woman looked
like one. Never suffer her to approach my darling again.
Mind that, Penelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>The jealous heart is not easily reassured. And Mrs.
Hamlyn, restless and suspicious, put the same question
to her husband. It was whilst they were waiting in the
drawing-room for dinner to be announced, and she had
come down from changing her apparel after her journey.
How handsome she looked! a right regal woman! as she
stood there arrayed in dark blue velvet, the firelight playing
upon her proud face, and upon the diamond earrings and
brooch she wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip, has that woman been prowling about here again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just for an imperceptible second, for thought is quick, it
occurred to Philip Hamlyn to temporize, to affect ignorance,
and say, What woman? just as if his mind was not full of
the woman, and of nothing else. But he abandoned it as
useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen her since; not at all,&rdquo; he answered:
and though his words were purposely indifferent, his wife,
knowing all his tones and ways by heart, was not deceived.
&ldquo;He is afraid of that woman,&rdquo; she whispered to herself;
&ldquo;or else afraid of <em>me</em>.&rdquo; But she said no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come to any definite understanding with Mr.
Carradyne in regard to Peacock&rsquo;s Range, Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not come to any; he is civilly obstinate over
it. Laughs in my face with the most perfect impudence,
and tells me: &lsquo;A man must be allowed to put in his own
claim to his own house, when he wants to do so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Eliza, that seems to be only right and fair.
Peveril made no positive agreement with us, remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Is</em> it right and fair? That may be your opinion,
Philip, but it is not mine. We shall see, Mr. Harry
Carradyne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner is served, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; announced the old butler.</p>

<p>That evening passed. Sunday passed, the last day of the
dying year; and Monday morning, New Year&rsquo;s Day, dawned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>New Year&rsquo;s Day. Mr. and Mrs. Hamlyn were seated at
the breakfast-table. It was a bright, cold, sunny morning,
showing plenty of blue sky. Young Master Walter, in
consideration of the day, was breakfasting at their table,
seated in his high chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me to have dinner wid mamma to-day! Me have
pudding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you shall, my sweetest; and everything that&rsquo;s
good,&rdquo; assented his mother.</p>

<p>In came Japhet at this juncture. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little boy
in the hall, sir, asking to see you,&rdquo; said he to his master.
&ldquo;He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we shall have plenty of boys here to-day, asking
for a new year&rsquo;s gift,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Hamlyn, rather
impatiently. &ldquo;Send him a shilling, Philip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a poor boy, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered Japhet, &ldquo;but a
little gentleman: six or seven years old, he looks. He says
he particularly wants to see master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn smiled. &ldquo;Particularly wants a shilling, I
expect. Send him in, Japhet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad came in. A well-dressed beautiful boy, refined
in looks and demeanour, bearing in his face a strange
likeness to Mr. Hamlyn. He looked about timidly.</p>

<p>Eliza, struck with the resemblance, gazed at him. Her
husband spoke. &ldquo;What do you want with me, my
lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, are you Mr. Hamlyn?&rdquo; asked the
child, going forward with hesitating steps. &ldquo;Are you my
papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every drop of blood seemed to leave Philip Hamlyn&rsquo;s
face and fly to his heart. He could not speak, and looked
white as a ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What is your name?&rdquo; imperiously
demanded Philip&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Walter Hamlyn,&rdquo; replied the lad, in clear, pretty
tones.</p>

<p>And now it was Mrs. Hamlyn&rsquo;s turn to look white.
Walter Hamlyn?&mdash;the name of her own dear son! when
she had expected him to say Sam Smith, or John Jones!
What insolence some people had!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from, boy? Who sent you here?&rdquo;
she reiterated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come from mamma. She would have sent me before,
but I caught cold, and was in bed all last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlyn rose. It was a momentous predicament,
but he must do the best he could in it. He was a man of
nice honour, and he wished with all his heart that the earth
would open and engulf him. &ldquo;Eliza, my love, allow me
to deal with this matter,&rdquo; he said, his voice taking a low,
tender, considerate tone. &ldquo;I will question the boy in
another room. Some mistake, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Philip, you must put your questions before me,&rdquo;
she said, resolute in her anger. &ldquo;What is it you are
fearing? Better tell me all, however disreputable it may
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare not tell you,&rdquo; he gasped; &ldquo;it is not&mdash;I fear&mdash;the
disreputable thing you may be fancying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not dare! By what right do you call this gentleman
&lsquo;papa&rsquo;?&rdquo; she passionately demanded of the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma told me to. She would never let me come
home to him before because of not wishing to part from
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamlyn gazed at him. &ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Calcutta; that&rsquo;s in India. Mamma brought me home
in the <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>, and the ship went down, but
quite everybody was not lost in it, though papa thought
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy had evidently been well instructed. Eliza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Hamlyn, grasping the whole truth now, staggered in
terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip! Philip! is it true? Was it <em>this</em> you feared?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a motion of assent and covered his face.
&ldquo;Heaven knows I would rather have died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood back against the window-curtains, that they
might shade his pain. She fell into a chair and wished he
<em>had</em> died, years before.</p>

<p>But what was to be the end of it all? Though Eliza
Hamlyn went straight out and despatched that syren of the
golden hair with a poison-tipped bodkin (and possibly her
will might be good to do it), it could not make things any
the better for herself.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>New Year&rsquo;s Night at Leet Hall, and the banquet in full
swing&mdash;but not, as usual, New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>

<p>Captain Monk headed his table, the parson, Robert
Grame, at his right hand, Harry Carradyne on his left.
Whether it might be that the world, even that out-of-the-way
part of it, Church Leet, was improving in manners and
morals; or whether the Captain himself was changing:
certain it was that the board was not the free board it used
to be. Mrs. Carradyne herself might have sat at it now,
and never once blushed by as much as the pink of a seashell.</p>

<p>It was known that the chimes were to play this year;
and, when midnight was close at hand, Captain Monk
volunteered a statement which astonished his hearers.
Rimmer, the butler, had come into the room to open the
windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am getting tired of the chimes, and all people have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
not liked them,&rdquo; spoke the Captain in slow, distinct
tones. &ldquo;I have made up my mind to do away with them,
and you will hear them to-night, gentlemen, for the last
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Really</em>, Uncle Godfrey!&rdquo; cried Harry Carradyne, in
most intense surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll bring us no ill-luck to-night!&rdquo; continued
Captain Monk as a grim joke, disregarding Harry&rsquo;s remark.
&ldquo;Perhaps they will, though, out of sheer spite, knowing
they&rsquo;ll never have another chance of it. Well, well, they&rsquo;re
welcome. Fill your glasses, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rimmer was throwing up the windows. In another
minute the church clock boomed out the first stroke of
twelve, and the room fell into a dead silence. With the
last stroke the Captain rose, glass in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A happy New Year to you, gentlemen! A happy
New Year to us all. May it bring to us health and
prosperity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And God&rsquo;s blessing,&rdquo; reverently added Robert Grame
aloud, as if to remedy an omission.</p>

<p>Ring, ring, ring! Ah, there it came, the soft harmony
of the chimes, stealing up through the midnight air. Not
quite as loudly heard perhaps, as usual, for there was no
wind to waft it, but in tones wondrously clear and sweet.
Never had the strains of &ldquo;The Bay of Biscay&rdquo; brought to
the ear more charming melody. How soothing it was to
those enrapt listeners; seeming to tell of peace.</p>

<p>But soon another sound arose to mingle with it. A
harsh, grating sound, like the noise of wheels passing over
gravel. Heads were lifted; glances expressed surprise.
With the last strains of the chimes dying away in the
distance, a carriage of some kind galloped up to the hall
door.</p>

<p>Eliza Hamlyn alighted from it&mdash;with her child and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
nurse. As quickly as she could make opportunity after
that scene enacted in her breakfast-room in London in the
morning, that is, as soon as her husband&rsquo;s back was turned,
she had quitted the house with the maid and child, to take
the train for home, bringing with her&mdash;it was what she
phrased it&mdash;her shameful tale.</p>

<p>A tale that distressed Mrs. Carradyne to sickness. A tale
that so abjectly terrified Captain Monk, when it was imparted
to him on Tuesday morning, as to take every atom of fierceness
out of his composition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Hamlyn&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Eliza!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not his wife,&rdquo; she retorted, a great deal too angry
herself to be anything but fierce and fiery. &ldquo;That other
woman, that false first wife of his, was not drowned, as
was set forth, and she has come to claim him with their
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife; their son,&rdquo; muttered the Captain as if he were
bewildered. &ldquo;Then what are you?&mdash;what is your son?
Oh, my poor Eliza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what are we? Papa, I will bring him to answer
for it before his country&rsquo;s tribunal&mdash;if there be law in the
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one spoke to this. It may have occurred to them to
remember that Mr. Hamlyn could not legally be punished
for what he did in innocence. Captain Monk opened the
glass doors and walked on to the terrace, as if the air of the
room were oppressive. Eliza went out after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there now exists all the more
reason for your making my darling <em>your</em> heir. Let it
be settled without delay. He must succeed to Leet
Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Monk looked at his daughter as if not understanding
her. &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My child, you
forget; trouble must be obscuring your faculties. None but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
a <em>legal</em> descendant of the Monks could be allowed to have
Leet Hall. Besides, apart from this, it is already settled.
I have seen for some little time now how unjust it would be
to supplant Harry Carradyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <em>he</em> to be your heir? Is it so ordered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Irrevocably. I have told him so this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; she wailed in bitter despair.
&ldquo;Papa, what is to become of me&mdash;and of my unoffending
child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know: I wish I did know. It will be a cruel
blight upon us all. You will have to live it down, Eliza.
Ah, child, if you and Katherine had only listened to me,
and not made those rebellious marriages!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned away as he spoke in the direction of the church,
to see that his orders were being executed there. Harry
Carradyne ran after him. The clock was striking midday
as they entered the churchyard.</p>

<p>Yes, the workmen were at their work&mdash;taking down the
bells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the time were to come over again, Harry,&rdquo; began
Captain Monk as they were walking homeward, he leaning
upon his nephew&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have them put up.
They don&rsquo;t seem to have brought luck somehow, as the
parish has been free to say. Not but that it must be utter
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, they don&rsquo;t, uncle,&rdquo; assented Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As one grows in years, one gets to look at things
differently, lad. Actions that seemed laudable enough when
one&rsquo;s blood was young and hot, crop up again then, wearing
another aspect. But for those chimes, poor West would not
have died as he did. I have had him upon my mind a good
bit lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely Captain Monk was wonderfully changing! And
he was leaning heavily upon Harry&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you tired, uncle? Would you like to sit down on
this bench and rest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not tired. It&rsquo;s West I&rsquo;m thinking about. He
lies on my mind sadly. And I never did anything for the
wife or child to atone to them! It&rsquo;s too late now&mdash;and has
been this many a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry Carradyne&rsquo;s heart began to beat a little. Should
he say what he had been hoping to say sometime? He
might never have a better opportunity than this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Godfrey,&rdquo; he spoke in low tones, &ldquo;would you&mdash;would
you like to see Mr. West&rsquo;s daughter? His wife has
been dead a long while; but&mdash;would you like to see her&mdash;Alice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; fervently spoke the old man. &ldquo;If she be in the
land of the living, bring her to me. I&rsquo;ll tell her how
sorry I am, and how I would undo the past if I could.
And I&rsquo;ll ask her if she&rsquo;ll be to me as a daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So then Harry Carradyne told him all. It was Alice West
who was already under his roof, and who, fate and fortune
permitting, <em>Heaven</em> permitting, would sometime be Alice
Carradyne.</p>

<p>Down sat Captain Monk on a bench of his own accord.
Tears rose to his eyes. The sudden revulsion of feeling
was great: and truly he was a changed man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke of Heaven, Harry. I shall begin to think it
has forgiven me. Let us be thankful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Captain Monk found he had more to thank Heaven
for ere many minutes had elapsed. As Harry Carradyne
sat by him in silence, marvelling at the change, yet knowing
that the grievous blow which was making havoc of Eliza
had effected the completeness of the subduing, he caught
sight of an approaching fly. Another fly from the railway
station at Evesham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you come here, you villain!&rdquo; shouted Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Monk, rising in threatening anger, as the fly&rsquo;s inmate called
to the driver to stop and began to get out of it. &ldquo;Are you
not ashamed to show your face to me, after the evil you
have inflicted upon my daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philip Hamlyn, smiling kindly and calmly, caught Captain
Monk&rsquo;s lifted hands. &ldquo;No evil, sir,&rdquo; he said, soothingly.
&ldquo;It was all a mistake. Eliza is my true and lawful
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the Captain quite in a whisper,
his lips trembling.</p>

<p>Quietly Philip Hamlyn explained. He had taken the
previous day to investigate the matter, and had followed his
wife down by a night train. His first wife <em>was</em> dead. She
had been drowned in the <cite>Clipper of the Seas</cite>, as was
supposed. The child was saved, with his nurse: the only
two passengers who were saved. The nurse made her way
to a place in the south of France, where, as she knew, her
late mistress&rsquo;s sister lived, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connett, formerly Miss
Sophia Pratt. Mrs. O&rsquo;Connett, a young widow, had just lost
her only child, a boy about the age of the little one rescued
from the cruel seas. She seized on him with feverish avidity,
adopted him as her own, quitted the place for another Anglo-French
town where she was not previously known, taught
the child to call her &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; and had never let it
transpire that the boy was not hers. But now, after the
lapse of a few years, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connett was on the eve of
marriage with an Irish Major. To him she told the truth;
and, as he did not want to marry the child as well as herself,
he persuaded her to return him to his father. Mrs.
O&rsquo;Connett brought the child to London, ascertained Mr.
Hamlyn&rsquo;s address, and all about him, and watched about
to speak to him, alone if possible, unknown to his wife.
Remembering what had been the behaviour of the child&rsquo;s
mother, she was by no means sure of a good reception from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Philip himself, or what adverse influence might be brought
to bear by the new ties he had formed. Mrs. O&rsquo;Connett
had the same remarkable and lovely hair that her sister had
had, whom she very much resembled; she had also a talent
for underhand ways.</p>

<p>That was the truth&mdash;and I have had to tell it in a
nutshell, space growing limited. Philip Hamlyn had
ascertained it all beyond possibility of dispute, had
seen Mrs. O&rsquo;Connett, and had brought down the good
tidings.</p>

<p>Of all the curious sights this record has afforded, perhaps
the most surprising was to see Captain Monk pass his arm
lovingly within that of Philip Hamlyn and march off with
him to Leet Hall as if he were a prize to be coveted.
&ldquo;Here he is, Eliza,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he has come to cheer both
you and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For once in her life Eliza Hamlyn was subdued to meekness.
She kissed her husband and shed happy tears. She
was his lawful wife, and the little one was his lawful child.
True, there was an elder son; but, compared with what had
been feared, that was a slight evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must make them true brothers, Eliza,&rdquo; whispered
Philip Hamlyn. &ldquo;They shall share alike all I have and
all I leave behind me. And our own little one must be
called James in future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you and I will be good friends from henceforth,&rdquo;
cried Captain Monk warmly, clasping Philip Hamlyn&rsquo;s ready
hand. &ldquo;I have been to blame in more ways than one,
giving the reins unduly to my arbitrary temper. It seems
to me, however, that life holds enough of real angles for us
without creating any for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And surely it did seem, as Mrs. Carradyne would have
liked to point out aloud, that those chimes had been fraught
with messages of evil. For had not all these blessings set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
in with their removal?&mdash;even in the very hour that their fate
was sealed!</p>

<p>Harry Carradyne had drawn his uncle from the room; he
now came in again, bringing Alice West. Her face was a
picture of agitation, for she had been made known to
Captain Monk. Harry led her up to Mrs. Hamlyn, with a
beaming smile and a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliza, as we seem to be going in generally for amenities,
won&rsquo;t you give just a little corner of your heart to <em>her</em>?
We owe her some reparation for the past. It is her
father who lies in that grave at the north end of the
churchyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eliza started. &ldquo;Her father! Poor George West her
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just a moment&rsquo;s struggle with her rebellious spirit and
Mrs. Hamlyn stooped to kiss the trembling girl. &ldquo;Yes,
Alice, we do owe you reparation amongst us, and we must
try to make it,&rdquo; she said heartily. &ldquo;I see how it is: you
will reign here with Harry; and I think he will be able, after
all, to let us keep Peacock&rsquo;s Range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a grand wedding, Captain Monk himself
giving Alice away. But Mr. and Mrs. Hamlyn did not
retain Peacock&rsquo;s Range; they and their boys, the two
Walters, had to look out for another local residence; for
Mrs. Carradyne retired to Peacock&rsquo;s Range herself. Now
that Leet Hall had a young mistress, she deemed it policy
to quit it; though it should have as much of her as it pleased
as a visitor. And Captain Godfrey Monk made himself
happier in these peaceful days than he had ever been in his
stormy ones.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the history. If I had to begin it again, I
don&rsquo;t think I should write it; for I have had to take its
details from other people&mdash;chiefly from the Squire and old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Mr. Sterling, of the Court. There&rsquo;s nothing of mine in it,
so to say, and it has been only a bother.</p>

<p>And those unfortunate chimes have nearly passed out of
memory with the lapse of years. The &ldquo;Silent Chimes&rdquo;
they are always called when, by chance, allusion is made to
them, and will be so called for ever.</p>

admirably written, that one hardly knows how to go to bed without reading
to the very last page.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Observer.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A work of remarkable power which displays a force of description and a
dramatic completeness we have seldom seen surpassed. The interest of the
narrative intensifies itself to the deepest pathos. The closing scene is in the
highest degree tragic, and the whole management of the story exhibits unquestionable
genius and originality.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Daily News.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;East Lynne&rsquo; has been translated into the Hindustani and Parsee languages,
and the success of it has been very great.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daniel Bandmann&rsquo;s Journal.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was having a delightful conversation with a clever Indian officer, and
listening to his reminiscences of being sent out to serve in China with Gordon.
He gave me an account of how he tried to keep the regimental library together
under difficulties, and how &lsquo;East Lynne&rsquo; was sent to them from England.
Gordon got hold of it, and was fascinated. He used to come riding from a
distance, at some risk, to get hold of the volumes as they were to be had.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Extract

romantic touch to the story which Sir Walter Scott so often used with even

supernatural touches generally, and inartistically, were.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Spectator.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The genius of Mrs. Henry Wood shines as brightly as ever. There is a
scene or two between Maria Godolphin and her little girl just before she dies,

<p class="st">EIGHTIETH THOUSAND.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Henry Wood certainly possesses in a wholly exceptional degree the
power of uniting the most startling incident of supernatural influence with
a certain probability and naturalness which compels the most critical and
sceptical reader, having once begun, to go on reading.... He finds himself
conciliated by some bit of quiet picture, some accent of poetic tenderness,
some sweet domestic touch telling of a heart exercised in the rarer experiences;
and as he proceeds he wonders more and more at the manner in which the
mystery, the criminality, the plotting, and the murdering reconciles itself with
a quiet sense of the justice of things; and a great moral lesson is, after all,
found to lie in the heart of all the turmoil and exciting scene-shifting. It is
this which has earned for Mrs. Wood so high a place among popular novelists,
and secured her admittance to homes from which the sensational novelists
so-called are excluded.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Nonconformist.</span></p>
